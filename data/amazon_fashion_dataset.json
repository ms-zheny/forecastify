One of my ankles swells and these worked great because I was able to adjust the ankle strap to where it was comfortable. The only reason I’m giving them 4 stars is because they stained the bottom of my feet orange. It rained a little bit on the first day I wore them so I’m thinking maybe them getting a little wet is what caused it, but it took some scrubbing to get it off."

      "text": "This was so close to the perfect bra. Having front close hooks AND adjustable size hooks in the back is genius. This is great for those with mobility or health issues that require a front closure which typically lacks adjustability in band size. Women aren't plastic mannequins. We can vary in size day by day due to our cycles, what we eat, etc. What I didn't like: the unlined cups gave me a very odd scooped but sort of smooshed to the sides shape. Odd cup shapes has long been a problem for me with this brand. Perhaps some light sewn in lining would rather than the stretchy fabric cup would help this issue. I also found the band to be too tight compared to other brands in this size. If you don't care about shape and are going for comfort with easy on and off, this bra may be for you."

  "description": "From the brand Lightweight Cardigan Previous page Best choice Black cardigan for women Most Wished Navy cardigan women Wardrobe Essentials Grey cardigan women New Color You will like--- Next page Product Description NOTE Lightweight and skin friendly fabric, a little thinner than a t-shirt, so that does cause it to wrinkle. When you receive it you can wash it in cold and hung on a hanger to dry and the wrinkles will decrease. Just the right thickness for Summer evenings or Spring/Fall.The light color, like white, may be a little see through. Note: Do remind to check the size chart before ordering. This cardigan is in normal size, if you are more like a loose sense, then ordered up a size and the sleeve is slim fit! Tip: Color may vary slightly from image. Colors may vary from different viewing devices.. For the color of the product, please refer to the actual received. DESIGN&OCCASION Great for jeans, leggings, or little dresses,completes an out fit for a wedding! Perfect sweater for just about any event - I bought it for a chamber music performance, and also wear it to teach and for church. It is very comfortable, soft, and flattering! I bought 2 colors Gray and brown . They are fantastic the material very soft and very light excellent for office . I wear all the time at work. The fitting was so perfect . I highly recommend this product to my co workers and to all woman who loves to wear light blazer! I ordered this to go over a sleeveless dress. I love it! The cut is flattering, not boxy. I’m 5’ 4” and weigh about 185. I ordered an XL and it fits great. The length covers my bubble butt. Sleeves are 3/4 length and easily push up and STAY! Not tight on upper arms. It is made of cotton and spandex, not sheer so it covers what needs to be covered without being bulky. Highly recommended! HIGH QUANLITY MATERIAL Does this wrinkle easily? Is this hard to iron? The material is super soft,does not wrinkle and washes great!! If you dry on low, take out of dryer quickly and hang u, it does not need ironing. It doesn't wrinkle easily. Once it fell off the chair I had it on and was on the floor overnight, and it only wrinkled a bit. I lightly steamed it, and it was fine. When I took it out of the package, it smelled bad. Always wash before putting on clothes. After washing, there will be no smell and no wrinkles. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this little cardi!!! The material is soft, its really good quality, not thin, not thick, 3/4 sleeves looks just like the picture the seller posted & it’s perfect, it lays nicely & I absolutely love it I wish they had it in every color ! For reference, I am 5’3” & I weigh 134lbs, I purchased a small & it’s fits me perfectly! Great for jeans, leggings, or little dresses, I’m sooooo happy I bought this. I do not put most of my clothes from Amazon in the dryer, esp if I’m unsure of quality, so idk if it would shrink, I wash everything on normal then hang to dry & my clothes, I lightly sprayed this cardi with some water in a spray bottle after hanging to dry & it looked like I ironed it. About Size: Depending on her type of body on the top, I'm 5'2, small torso, 36C (it doesn't matter because it is open). I think the small will fit. It is beautiful I think it runs true to size. I’m 5’1” and weigh 147 . I got a medium and am very happy with the way it hangs...hope this helps! It’s really cute and the fabric is very soft. I ordered this to go over a sleeveless dress. I love it! The cut is flattering, not boxy. I’m 5’ 4” and weigh about 185 . I ordered an XL and it fits great. The length covers my bubble butt. Sleeves are 3/4 length and easily push up and STAY! Not tight on upper arms. This is the perfect light weight sweater cardigan . I am 5ft 4inches and 165 pounds . I bought black xxl . I am a 40 c . The sleeves go two tge elbow not past . The sleeve has a nice fit . I just returned from the pool . I had a black cover up and put this light cardigan on . It is perfect . I realize that black on black on black is difficult to see .

I'm 48C with fairly broad shoulders, and it drapes nicely. Obviously not having a closure in the front helps the \"free sizing\". The material is that thin, slippery one that everything out of China seems to be made of these days- minus one star for that because it is SO easily snagged. (watch your fingernails) It will not, in any way, keep you warm. This is for looks. I only wanted it to add the pop of red color to a costume outfit (phoenix/firebird) so it worked for me. I would recommend it for a light shrug over a sleeveless dress on a summer night."

Also, even with how fun these are and how well they are made; If you have kids or are active like me in your Crocs then be prepared to lose 1 or 2 of your charms in the year. I already lost the pizza charm in this pack due to idk what-- they pop off quietly and unless you see them go, good luck finding them again! However, they are fun and cute and add personality to your Crocs. So I wont ever stop getting them, I'll only stop buying them separately lol."

Three of the four shirts I received fit perfectly, but one of them is roughly an inch and a half shorter than the other three.

We have several Baseball pants & on inspection once they arrived, I found the material on these to be a little thin & sheer/see through, I am comparing them to NIKE & another brandless grey pants we own. We have never purchased Easton pants before so it will remain to be seen how well they perform on the field. I bought these in a Medium for my nearly 12yo daughter, the waist size appears to be the same as her small pair of NIKE brand she owns, except the Easton's are a couple of inches longer at the leg. They will need to be worn with a belt but that's OK, I expected that! Honestly, if I was to actually inspect the pants before purchasing, I would probably give them a miss just due to the sheerness, but if they prove to be durable, then I'll be back for more no doubt! I should add the price was great too!"

There's nothing majorly wrong with this, I just don't personally care for halter tops as they hurt my neck and can be uncomfortable. The bra is very cute and fits great. I wear a 34C/36B and got a medium. Soft, comfy, and the straps aren't too long or stretchy so it gives decent support. However, the elastic bit tacked on to the back is not adjustable (like in the photos) and isn't short/strong enough to do anything, so the pressure of the straps is all on my neck. It seems like they had a halter bra that they just converted to a 'racerback' without actually adjusting the design. Doesn't totally work for me. Because I like the fit, though, I am ordering another Shekini bralette that is very similar and has crossed straps in the back. I will compare and see which one I like better. Hopefully it will be a winner!"

They are thinner than you usually get in the UK, but for us that works out well as we use then under a 2.5 tog sleeping bag in a 19deg room. They are slim fitting, but despite having a chunky baby they fit well. Admittedly she's 80th centile, 15lb 10oz at 4 months and wearing 6-9 with sleeves and legs rolled up once, but then she's mostly in 6-9 from tesco/next etc anyway. A couple of things I personally think could be done better: * A double ended zip, so you can just open the bottom half for nappy changes, rather than exposing baby's whole body, especially for night time changes! * Fabric covering the inside face of the zip. Admittedly my baby hasn't had any problems or skin irritation with the zip on her skin, but I'd have expected to see it covered nonetheless"

The plastic support which wraps round the back and sides of the shoes dig into your arches if you have flat feet 3. I'm not sure but I think the foam is harder on this one.

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2020",
      "text": "These are great pants with deep front pockets that will fit almost any smart phone, and they are secure due to the angle of the pocket opening. I own these in multiple colors. If you are between sizes, you should consider sizing down. If you have a flat bum, these will fit baggier in the back upper thigh. The fabric does relax a bit as you wear the pants, and while there is a fair amount of stretch and recovery, they do not completely recover to the \"just washed\" fit after you have worn them for an hour or so. I would say the \"slim\" fit is appropriate, as the legs are tapered but not skinny. The fit is work-appropriate, and I haven't noticed issues with show-through. The fabric for most of the colors is a stretch twill, but the navy houndstooth is a sateen print. Due to the print, the black of the houndstooth is not as dark as it could be, although I like the print. The sateen has better recovery than the twill (doesn't get as baggy with wearing), and I have noticed some variation in fit between the gray and breen colored versions I have, with the breen color fitting looser. I am unsure whether this is due to variation in the stretch of the fabric for each color, or variations in cutting/sewing. This is the only thing I would remove one star for -- it would be great if the fit were more consistent. The twill fabric is not truly wrinkle free, but I have not hat a problem with significant wrinkles after line drying and wearing them. If you wanted a front crease or sharper look, I'm sure you could press them. Given the very affordable price, I have not noticed significant flaws in the fabrication of any of my 4 pairs. There is no topstitching, and the pants are hemmed with a blind hem stitch. When I first bought these pants, I thought the twill fabric was a bit more casual than I would like. Now that I am mostly working from home, I am very happy that I have these as my work pants. Even though you usually can't see people's pants on conference calls (insert joke here..), I really find it helpful to maintain the routine of getting ready for work in the morning, and these pants help me do that."

I really like the fit, until my lower leg. These pants kind of flare out from the calf down - unfortunately this is pretty common with my larger thighs, but I don’t like that the look more flared than slim. I feel like the pant is a bit long - well below my ankle bone - and doesn’t look quite as long in the picture, which I don’t love. They are ever so slightly tight around my waist, but that’s pretty common for me and I’d rather them be a bit snug since I’m consistently losing weight. If it matters to anyone (doesn’t to me), they don’t have belt loops. I ordered the colour “Cosmic,” which is noticeably a deep blue/navy in the picture. However, they are so extremely dark in person (in any lighting, not just the crappy mirror lighting in the pics) that they look black. I like a dark navy, but not so dark that I can’t even tell that it’s supposed to be blue. Overall, not a bad pant at all - I’m just not sure they’re for me. I may try reordering a 10 short in a different colour to see if the shorter length and more noticeable colour change my mind, or I may just suck it up and keep them because I start a new job in a few days and need some pants."

Unfortunately for me, they are a fairly straight style; a little too big in the waist, a little too tight in the hips. With functional front & back pockets and great neutral color (\"breen\") I really wanted these to work, but they're going back. If you're less \"endowed\" in the booty, by all means, these are your pants."

I don't have much experience with the Lee brand but I was looking for a pair of non-denim skinny pull ons. These are fine. They run a bit large so I would size down if I bought again (instead of 12, I'd go 10). They are looser than expected in the calf/ankle area. They feel more like regular work trousers than slim fit. Overall I actually prefer the black denim skinny pull ons that Levis makes. They look like trousers, but fit like a glove. The material on the Lees are a bit scratchy, too, even though they are made of cotton. Overall I'm a bit meh on these. I bought them, I kept them, and I wear them. But I wouldn't buy another pair. They're inexpensive, so I can't really complain. But if you're looking for actual slim fit, these probably don't fit the bill."

They are flattering with a good weight of fabric with pockets that stay flat. Washes well and no iron required. Very versatile, smart enough for the office and casual enough for weekends. Update: The other two pairs arrived. The navy and the black. They are so disappointing and nothing like my original houndstooth pair. These plain coloured pants are a completely different material. Thin with nowhere near the same amount of stretch. They are at least a half size smaller than the original pair. If this was my first purchase there wouldn’t have been any further purchases and I am still trying to remove the residue from the label. (See photo)"

Issues I ran into were the length, which I really am not distressed about as I this product is pretty much one size fits all, and I am only 5’1”. I didn’t like that the strings to the hood unraveled rather quickly, which made it difficult to keep around my neck while moving around. Pretty standard thin piece of velour.

      "text": "Well, the pro is the fabric is a little thicker than my last generic pair of black gloves. I started off annoyed because I was shipped the wrong glove (flap instead of no flap), however I suppose that's not a fault in the product. It's lucky I didn't want flaps though because the flap itself is secured with a long thread that weaves in and out of the glove, and it is snapped to the button by way of another single stitch made of a couple threads. Well that button securing thread was broke on the right glove so it would not snap to the button out of the package. Floppy flap syndrome. :-( I was going to cut the flaps off anyway because it would have been more hassle to return it than just take them off. If the single stitch that secures the whole flap to the glove itself is severed it is easily pulled all all across the glove. So basically, if either single stitch to secure the flap to the glove or the one to lock the flap to the button is (easily) broken, your flap is history real quick. That's a bummer if you actually wanted the flaps there. Not a big deal for me though since I didn't want the flaps anyway. So flaps and buttons are now gone. The stitching around the fingers looked like the stitching I put in when I made my own pair with my sewing machine. Honestly it's already frayed out of the package and will probably start to fall out after 3 weeks. I'll try to reinforce it a little when that happens. I wouldn't mind as much if they were like half the price but $10 to me is about the price where I expect them to have somewhat better stitching for something so small and simple. Overall I was hoping for more of a closed knit design at the fingers, not cutoff gloves with a stitch to keep them from unraveling. I really could have done that myself with 99c store gloves. But... in the end, they are keeping my hands warm at this very moment while allowing me to type. So I guess they are doing what they're supposed to do. Even if they aren't the best. Will I buy again? I don't know, I might try to find some wool ones with a high thread count next time so that the fingers wont fall out eventually even if it costs me 25 bucks."

      "text": "These are decent gloves.I bought a pair last year, and I'm still wearing the same pair. I ordered my husband a pair once the cold weather hit, per his request. They're pretty warm as long as it's not bitterly cold- I wish there were thumb flaps on the thumbs, but I knew what I was getting when I ordered. One star off because the pair this year- when ordered off of the same exact listing- is a different material. It has slightly less give to it and isn't as soft. I assume this will improve with time, but my gloves were perfectly soft out of the package. All in all a good pair of gloves, but if it's particularly windy or bitterly cold (under 15F) they probably won't do much if you're outside for extended periods of time. However these are very good for your usual house-to-car-to-other building type of being outside. Also driving. They definitely keep your hands warm until your car warms up. The button to secure the flap is not sewn on very securely- it will come loose, as will the little loop on the mitten flap to keep the flap secure. I don't bother securing them anymore, honestly it's easier since I put the flaps on and off several times while I'm out. No stars deducted for the flap not being able to be secure- just making everyone aware to not expect the flap to stay secured for extended periods of time."

I can handle the leash and the flashlight easily and even the \"poop collection\" is easy cause I can flip the mitten flaps off and have my fingers to do the work. My thumbs get cold, but that is just the nature of the critter, so to speak."

Now I just flip the flap back, do what needs to be done, flip the flap over the fingers again and my hands stay warm. Even w/ the flap off (flipped back) the fingers are mostly covered so you stay warm. THey come to just over the distal knuckle so almost the entire finger except the tip stays warm and covered. I'd really like to give them 4.5 stars because the button loop which you can use to keep the flap tacked back, came detached. But since I don't want to keep it permanently flapped back, it's not a big deal"

I am very slender and small-chested (32B, 25” waist for reference) and these seem to be shaped for someone with more curves on top. I am 5’8”and they hit me at just above the crotch, so they could be tucked in if you wanted to. I wouldn't wear them as an undershirt because they are just too boxy and would add too much bulk. I ordered the smallest size and I still feel like I am swimming in them. The material is like a comfy t-shirt with a little bit of stretch, but not much. The stitching and quality of the fabric seems fine. They should last me for quite a while. I have washed them twice now and they haven't faded or shrunk."

According to the reviews, I ordered an XS as I didn’t want these to be at all baggy. They ended up fitting me like a medium, so fairly baggy. Which wouldn’t be a problem, but that makes the arm holes so loose that I’m not comfortable wearing these (especially to church) without a jacket or sweater over them. I was hoping they would shrink some in the first wash/dry but I can’t tell that they did. On a positive note, the neckline is a very comfortable size! Not tight on me but not showing too much. And I love the length! It’s a perfect length and doesn’t ride up at all. They are very soft shirts and the green especially is a beautiful shade!"

Why the weather report? Because the heat here means that for at least six months of the year, the only clothes I wear are shorts and tank tops, I _know_ tank tops, and I demand a lot from them. These tanks measure up. They have deep armscyes and scoop necklines, allowing decent air-flow; they hang straight without miserable, heat-trapping cling; they are 100% cotton so they are both absorbent and breathable; they are very well-made; and they launder beautifully, without shrinking, even in hot water. I recommend them unequivocally. Are they \"flattering\"? (What does that even mean?) Let me just say that, when my hair is plastered to my skull with sweat, my face is boiled-lobster-red, and I have chosen to accessorize my ensemb with bags of ice or frozen veggies at my neck and armpits to try to avoid heat exhaustion...

While I do like the quality of the fabric, the sizing is a little off. Like many have suggested, go down a size if purchasing. Also, yes the arm holes! They’re pretty large.

      "text": "In some reviews people say the material is soft, others report it is not. I ordered a black pair Xl (I am a size 12.). These are little baggier than I expected and the material is soft but the texture does not flow or drape like a tshirt material would, as it appears they do in the photo. (This draped look is the look I wanted). This Material is thick and feels more like a very thick starched dress shirt would, which means the very wide leg opening holds its round shape and does not lay against your leg as you move. Since I have thinner legs, the wide leg almost looks like it has wire ring holding in its round shape. As I move my hips, the shorts stay stiff and don’t not move with me. Not at all happy about that. If you are more pear shaped, this may not be an issue. They will be a very cozy short to wear around the house so will keep them. I am wondering if the different colors may come in textures (as light and dark denim are always different too). The pics of the lighter colors show a very textured material that has a weave that is allowing the material to drape and flow. I may try ordering a different lighter color just to see. If your looking for for that draped look in the photo, don’t order the black, try a different color thats texture is very visible in the pics. I did wash and dry, not much shrinkage at all(the one time I was hoping there would be lol). They look o.k. Without ironing even though the material is thick but they do wrinkle a lot in front as you sit so ironing wouldn’t matter anyway. Being that I have black, it does not show to bad but if the lighter colors are the same way, it would be very obvious. I gave them a 4 because they are good quality. Just not what I wanted for my body type."

      "text": "I liked it from the pictures but IRL its not as good. The button close is insufficient. It requires a zipper closure that goes all around the wallet. The bottom does not close the wallet properly. If it was going to be button close it needs to buttons on the sides as well as the one in the middle and they need to be closer to the edge. The button in this wallet is too far in and thus the wallet does not fully close. It kinda hangs open like a gaping mouth. It stores a lot hut when you put anything in the slots the wallet bulges out more than I expected. I shall keep this wallet because it is very cute otherwise. But I am displeased. I expected better quality and make. It has slight fraying and I dont like how the slots were sewn. A much thinner fabric could have been used for the slots also so its a much thinner and slimmer wallet over all. The lip of the card holders is also fat. Not a preference of mine. I thought a bigger wallet would be great. But I’m not so sure now. Whenever I use this wallet kr take it with me I may have tk rubber band it closed on the sides or place it in a pouch of its own so that it may stay closed and not bulge out like it is currently. I havent even stuffed the wallet full. I barely have any cards or photos in my wallet. And all the zipper pouch barely has anything in it currently. I cant imagine putting too many coins or anything of substance in there. The make isnt too bad but it is a little flawed and I am not smiling ear to ear over this purchase like I hoped I would."

  "description": "From the manufacturer A Fit Like No Other ECCO designs footwear to meet your needs, whether you're taking the stairs, walking around the city all day, or scrambling over rocky slopes; ECCO delivers superior fit, durability, support and flexibility. Our advanced construction techniques and continuous exploration in materials science add up to comfort you can count on. You'll notice the difference immediately - and at the end of an intense hike or after walking a dozen blocks uptown, you'll continue to appreciate the difference of ECCO. Read more The ECCO Freedom Fit Conventional shoes fit across your feet at the toes, restricting the way your toes spread as you walk. ECCO's Freedom Fit is different; it offers a roomy toe box and fits more narrowly from heel to instep, suitable for most widths. Toes spread naturally to support your weight and foster a more comfortable walking experience. Feet of nearly all widths feel good in ECCO, comfort straight from the box. Read more ECCO Leather ECCO is one of the very few manufacturers to have its own tanneries where it processes its own hides and leathers. This ensures that ECCO has the highest quality control from raw materials to finished shoe. The various highly advanced processes and treatments, to which the hides are subjected, always reflect the look and specific function of the product. This ensures a perfect match of form and function. ECCO Comfort Fibre System This exclusive inlay sole is designed with a vegetable-tanned leather surface. Underneath is a soft layer of unique, moisture-absorbent foam; treated with AGION for long-lasting and effective control. The pumping effect of the foam is activated as you walk- pushing air through tiny holes in the lining to create comfortable air circulation around the foot. Polyurethane Soles Polyurethane (or PU) is a manufactured material that can take the place of rubber. PU is the longest lasting material for outsoles; often lasting 2-3 times longer than traditional materials. In an ECCO shoe, PU is made to be flexible and shock absorbing; requiring little to no break-in period and allowing the wearer to be comfortable longer. PU also retains is shape or 'Memory' longer, allowing the wearer the same support from the first day to the last in their ECCO shoes. These ECCO shoes have a nylon or TPU shank allowing the wearer to breeze through some security checkpoints without removing their shoes. Direct Injection Process Direct inject Production or DIP is a highly specialized process in which ECCO is a world leader. This discipline represents the core competence of ECCO sole technology- and one of the secrets behind the special and famous 'instant fit' of an ECCO shoe. It’s a process where the upper is placed into the mould, and liquid polyurethane (PU) is injected to shape the and anatomically correct midsole and / or outsole. Robot precision ensures a consistent quality regardless of the production location. Read more ",

Your toes never cramp at the end of the shoe, they are free to wiggle. It feels a little funny at first, but after a short period, I prefer this type of fit by far. These Fusion 2 Tie Oxford are a little stiff in the cuff around the ankle. Not enough to cause blisters or abrasion, just I can feel them rubbing.

ECCO makes several shoes that work for me. I am also flat-footed and use an arch support which consumes volume in the shoe, so I need them to run on the wide side. I am happy with this shoe as it adjusts to both feet and is fine for extensive walking. I also own the Black version of this shoe in a smooth leather that takes a kind shine. I like the black shoe better as it retains a better finish and appearance than the \"suede-like\" finish of the leather on this shoe. I would give the black shoe Five Stars and would do the same for this shoe if it stood up a little better in the looks department. But hey, one can't wear black all the time. So I would recommend this shoe if you want the color and finish."

I needed something comfortable enough to wear for 20+ hours at a time during international flights but dressy enough to wear with khakis for a day or so when the airline decides to delay my baggage. These turned out to be perfect. They were broken in after a few hours, extremely comfortable, and extremely well made. They would have been great if I'd been able to take long walks on the trip. (Winter in Korea took that option off the table). They're more on the casual than dress size. I always think it's silly when people say an item \"fit great\" or \"didn't fit\" in online reviews since everyone's body is different. I will say that I normally use a D or E width, and the medium version of these were fine. I'm a 10.5 in American shoes and the 44 was perfect. (I own several brands of European motorcycle boots and know that sometimes their sizes don't align precisely with American sizes, but Ecco's do). One final thing: I expected these shoes to be made in China but was pleased to see that they're from Portugual."

When I took it out of the plastic wrap and unfolded it, I was already concerned about the size. I am 5' 7\", 120 lbs. I often wear a woman's small but because I read other reviews I selected a medium. Before wash, this will fit however if you are hoping for a more loose fit, definitely size up at least 1 size. Fingers crossed it will still fit after washing. It also seems a little short in length overall. I do not wear crop style shirts and was expecting a typical length for a hoodie."

This beautiful costume even gives me support and coverage for my DD chest without a bra. I'm going to wear one anyway because it's sheer enough to be nippy, even though it's not sheer enough to see through. It arrived quickly and is well made. The belt is easy to put together. It even holds my heavy dagger! The belt and gauntlets are a thinner material, so I will see how they hold up. I think they will. To me it's worth the price as I will wear it to the Renaissance festival also. Also I have to hem everything, so that's not an issue with me. Itll be fine for taller women. The belt around the waist is a little long for me, but still hooks. I love that it shows a little skin, but not too much. Love the leg slits. I am wearing a costume necklace that covers some cleavage, it's not part of the outfit. Great outfit. 5 stars!"

The belt is tiny though, it’s squeezing and I won’t wear it with the costume. Again, I’m a straight body, box body type."

      "text": "This made me look and feel the way I hoped. I ended up feeling like Megara from Hercules. I like the fabric, which is crepey. And the color, which is maybe bluer than it seemed online for me but is still somewhere between blue and teal. The accessories are ok; I liked the headband a lot. It is revealing but also covers a lot of the abdomen area. It was a good balance for me and let me feel like I could reveal some midriff without being rolly. The bust was moderate on support. I think most folks could get away without a bra and feel pretty good about it. I did adjust a fair amount, but I was also on camera while wearing it so I was hyper aware of how it was fitting and looking. (I adjusted off camera) Main issues: * The width of the fabric on the bust. For me it cut into my underarms fiercely. I'll be looking for some sort of alteration that might help with this. I don't think I could wear it more than 3 hours because of it. * Length. It's very long. I'm 5'6\" and would have had to wear spike platforms to not walk on this. I ended up gathering it up like a wedding dress whenever I walked around. Made stairs particularly treacherous. * Minor, but the slits didn't show my legs the way I hoped when standing and moving around. This might be because of my own anatomy though, I have some belly and so maybe it was hanging too far away from my hips to do this effectively while standing. I was able to arrange it well to show off while sitting/laying though."

      "text": "Pros: - can look really cute with some tweaking (I recommend you only get this if you have some small ability to sew/modify it to fit your body type better and/or to fix some of the shoddy work done in the factory to make this thing.) - nice color (initially... see cons below about washing) - comes with its own accessories (gauntlets are good, belt thing was garbage, headband was cool) - light, flowy, and very breathable fabric for hot summer days (feels like you're naked - also see cons below) - can be made to fit in different periods/styles Cons: - odd proportions (the breast strap things were super narrow but the band and elastic around the torso was crazy huge, such that my breasts wouldn't stay covered but my torso was way too small, so it hung off of me weirdly until I resewed the top) - skirt is really really really long. I'm an average height (5'4\") and I literally had to cut off almost two feet from the front just so I could walk without tripping. - fabric is very thin and definitely feels and looks that way. Don't wear dark underwear or everyone on the planet will see it. Also don't stand in the sun or people can see through it. Also don't sweat or get rained on. Basically don't exist as a normal human in this outfit for long periods of time, lol. - color fades a lot even the first time you wash it. I very carefully washed it by hand in cold water with gentle detergent and it immediately lost about a third of its dye. That cute emerald/turquoise color turned into a sad almost gray/green dark pastel looking color. Overall I wasn't exactly disappointed by this purchase because for the price I wasn't expecting a lot and I really just needed a one day costume for Ren Faire. I did quite a bit of resewing on it to make it fit and lay a lot better, and that helped tremendously, even to the point where I got a lot of compliments on it and people asking where I got it. So I'd say that it worked out but that you should set your expectations for this reasonably."

The middle strap not only fit, but is lightly loose but still flattering. Dress is flowy but not loose, chest size is perfect. I think, if I’d wanted a tighter fit, I could’ve fit in a small—it’s up to the look you’re after. I feel like the loose strap adds to the costume, personally, & makes it easier to line up the circle of the strap to the circle in the center of the dress… which is such a lovely line up. Mine doesn’t appear to be sheer at all. Would recommend those sizes for similarly sized, lovely, wonderful human beings as well <3"

The accessories were plasticy and I can't work out the shoulder strap bit out, but I really just wanted the dress anyway. It would maybe last a couple of house parties or a festival before it rips though as the fabric is very thin."

Mir (1,68m) waren die Fransen zu lang und die Schlitze so tief, dass man meine komplette Unterwäsche sehen konnte.

Der Stoff war stark zerknittert und wäre auch durch mehrmaliges Bügeln nie knitterfrei geworden. Die Farbe wirkte eher dreckig.

Ansonsten ist das Kleid sehr tief ausgeschnitten. Hätte es umnähen müssen. Der Gürtel und die Armmanschetten sehen ziemlich künstlich aus.

Both in our 40s and both with some pounds to lose. I have weird feet and my right foot has a more pronounced bunion than my left and foot pain was becoming a thing that made me want to avoid walking. My last pair was some Go Walk Sketchers but I had worn them to point where bottom was smooth. I was having pain on outside of my foot and decided to go ahead and invest in better shoes. My oldest daughter ran cross country a few years back and swore by her Brooks. So I knew she would gladly take this pair if I ordered them and hated them since her foot size is same as mine. I went with this pair because it sounded like it would have the support I want and because it would come quickly. I got black with purpe and hte purple is pretty bright so it might clash a bit if I was back on work and wearing it on a jeans day with our school colors (blue and gold.) However my foot pain meant I wanted delivery speed and we are all remote now anyway. As soon as I put them on I noticed an immediate difference. Sorry kid, mama is keeping these shoes. I wore them for errands (prior to going into lockdown mode) and I barely noticed the foot pain that had me hobbling when barefoot. Did 3.5 miles in under an hour today in them and they are a million times better than what I was wearing. I did order the 8.5 because I am sometimes as 8 and sometimes an 8,5 depending on shoe. I have just the width of my thumb between my toe and end of shoe so I would say the fit is good. Might have been okay in an 8 but then again feet swell a bit with exercise so they have felt a little small if I had done that."

The gray part on the toe keeps making me thing something is on my foot when I catch it out of the corner of my eye. I may take a black sharpie to it to cover that up. I only tried this shoe today for one 10 hour shift. I can tell it has added support in the heals, ankles, and arches. I think its lacking in support in the toes. If thats what you need find another style. But I needed the support in my heals. These did not rub my ankles at all. They also didnt eat my socks like some shoe do. The shoe laces are not filled or are made of a different material than most common shoe laces but I think this helps them stay tied. I only had to tie them when I put them on and they stairs tied all day. I wear a size 7.5 in Nike and that is the brand I have been wearing for the last 10 years. I wanted something with the extra support in the heals and my mother recommended Brooks to me. I just guessed at the 7.5 size and they fit almost exactly the same. The only difference I noticed was that my big toe touches the top of the inside of the shoe. I dont know it thats just me of if this style is slightly slimmer than other shoes I typically purchase, but it was not enough to return them. I will update if they wear a hole in the shoe. Otherwise, I recommend these shoes."

I walk 5 miles approximately 5-6 days a week so I need a really superior running shoe. Buying the latest model (GTS 21) will cost $125-130 so finding the previous model, the GTS 20, at such a good price is a real bonus for me as I go through 3-4 pairs of Brooks every year. In most other shoes I wear a size 8 but in my Brooks Adrenaline I wear a 9. Amazon ordering is easy and shipping is fast, so that’s a plus. Highly recommend in particular if you wear Brooks shoes and know from experience that the Adrenaline is the shoe for you. If you have never worn Brooks shoes before I recommend getting fitted/evaluated for the right shoes for you at an independent running shoe store so that you can be sure Brooks are a fit for your feet and your exercise needs. Then you can feel confident making all future purchases from Amazon without needing to try them on."

I realized I needed to purchase new shoes with better support instead of my typical Van's. I bought a cheap pair of running shoes for $25 on Amazon which provided no relief. A post came up in my workout group asking about shoe recommendations and somebody suggested the Brooks Adrenaline shoe, and after doing more research I decided to try them out. Wow! The day these arrived on my porch, my knees were aching while just standing and cooking dinner. I put these on right away and I am not kidding when I say that I felt relief almost instantly. I seriously thought it would've taken a day or two. I am someone who has never owned a proper running shoe in my life. I've never liked the look of them. After feeling how supportive and comfortable these shoes are, I couldn't care less what they look like! (Although, the black shoe with the purple accents really isn't so bad!) I'm going to resume working out tomorrow, I will update again about whether or not it truly helps my knees."

      "text": "Great costume corset for my Renaissance festival outfit. Really cute just with jeans too. It is a costume corset, not steel boned, don't expect major waist reduction, so keep that in mind. Notes about fit/size: Take your waist measurement and subtract the number of inches you want to have space for on the lacings. So, for me, my waist is about 33-34\" relaxed, but I know that I like a good 4-6\" of adjustment space for the back lacing, so I always order for a 28-29\" corset waist. Medium was perfect for me, but if you're wanting to lace it all the way closed, you'd want go up a size or two. The modesty panel in the back is pretty generous, though, and with corsets it's always better to go a size smaller than a size too big. Once it's fully tightened in the back, it doesn't go tighter. Better to leave at least a couple inches for the laces. If it's slightly too tight, replacing the laces is super easy and inexpensive. If it's too big, there's not really anything you can do unless you have some serious skill with sewing and corset making. The lacing in the front is adjustable too, which is great because, while my breasts aren't that large comparitively at 34DD, I tend to have issues with things that fit my chest being too loose at the waist, or vise versa. Being able to adjust the bust area separate from the waist/overall corset is super useful for getting a great fit. Also very supportive once tightened, even without a bra on underneath. You do have to redo the laces yourself if you want them laced properly in the middle for easy tightening. If you have any other corsets, you can model off of those, or you can easily find instructions online about how to lace a corset. Personally, I'm planning to replace the laces on mine because I prefer slightly longer laces on my corsets to make getting them on and off by myself easier. Besides that, fantastic product, very well made. Note about seller: AXIYA Lovely Fashion was fantastic. When my order initially came in, it was missing the detachable garters. I sent them a message, and after confirming what I'd ordered and confirming my contact info, they sent me a whole new corset set within a week of the original arriving, and only a few days after my original message to them about the missing garters was sent. Highly recommend them! They went above and beyond to make sure I was happy with my order."

      "text": "I really liked this corset! It says that it comes with garters which is not true, but its a really great \"olden time\" corset. The strings used to lace up both the front and back are strong, making it easier to get a tight fit. The only problem I had was that the arm straps were not adjustable. They were a bit big for my arms, and kind of slid down my shoulders. I fixed this by pulling down further than needed, then tightening the straps so it would hold a bit better, still not perfect though. I'm not sure why Amazon is asking about its stretch, I personally feel like stretch is not an important factor, so disregard the rating on that in my opinion. I wore it to the Renaissance festival over a dress and I thought it looked great!"

Plus there's ample breathing room if you don't lace too tight. However, I took one star off because I didn't notice til I was at the fair that one of the shoulder ties was missing. Thankfully, at a glace you wouldn't notice and it didn't ruin the outfit, but it was a noted defect in the product."

      "text": "I am 5’5” and 205 lbs, 38 DDD. I normally wear a XL in shirts, I ordered this corset in a 3x based on manufacturing suggestions. This was the perfect size for me! This is a very well made, and comfortable, but I will make a couple of suggestions for a perfect fit, as it was very awkward out of the box. I’m a traveling vendor for Ren faires, so I wear steel boned and leather corsets a lot. I was looking for a cheaper, lighter weight option for smaller events during the summer months. This one definitely fit the bill! This corset has light weight plastic boning and made from a fabric inner lining and a soft, thin pleather outer lining. It’s not made to hold its shape rigidly, and won’t support the girls if you are on the bustier side like me, so you’ll still need an under support (bra) to save your back and fill out the top if you desire. There is a lot of extra room under the arms and straps. So it is very accommodating for curvy gals, but you’ll need to take those straps in with pins or sewing if you can’t fill out the top, they WILL slip down off your shoulders. Or be prepared to tighten the front and back laces tighter than shown in product images to take in that extra room. In order to get a good fit and a curvy profile, I went ahead and threaded the back like a traditional corset. Just skip the criss cross for the holes closest to the top of your rib cage under your gals, and thread into the hole above it, then continue criss cross. Tie the loose threads together in a knot near the end of the strings. I added a picture of my lacing pattern. Zip the front, but don’t lace the front. Pull the thumb loops until comfortable, pulling the hip lace or chest lace tighter as needed from the thumb loops. Tie these loops in a simple double knot, will look like a bow. Then just pull the gals up, and lace the front. Doing it this way will mean in the future you only have to undo the front to put on and off, keep a curvy shape, better support, and also makes minor adjustments of the fit easy on the fly. Hope this helps anyone looking! Would definitely buy again. Was exactly what I was expecting based on other reviews and manufacturers suggestions."

She was a master at getting them out of every single mitt I had purchase or they would just fall off as soon as you put them on. The cinched wrist on these make them stay on so much better than any other mitt we’ve tried. Now mind you they are huge compared to her little hands but so far she keeps them on so much better! We occasionally have to put them back on throughout the day but it’s not every 15 minutes! Couldn’t recommend them more for babies that are smaller!"

The short underneath Its see through and looks cheap but again it’s comfortable! I’m a tennis player so I’m looking for a pocket ball and this is 5 stars for that! If you not tennis girls then you’ll say this is really weird pocket shape but this is specific kind pocket for tennis balls 🎾 Anyway, I haven’t try to play tennis with this skirt yet!

I personally really like the design of the ball pocket on top of the spandex compared to my other tennis skirts. Update: After owning and washing this skirt for a few months, the material on the within the waste band is wrinkled/tangled and adds a slightly weird texture to the outside of the band. It’s hardly noticeable though and remains just as comfy."

      "text": "Honestly, I love the brand. I love their willingness to still put quality materials into their shoes. I purchased these knowing that they didn’t look as well manufactured as some of their other styles. Typically they have a brushed leather bottom and wood sole, this is completely rubber. I wear dress shoes daily and can see myself burning a hole in these like I do in all the other rubber soled shoes I have tried. The shoes are beautiful, I get tons of compliments. They are definitely eye catching and not over the top. The fit: I wear 10.5 or 11, I purchased 11 and without laces, my foot required a tighter fit. Toe doesn’t pinch or crush the toes. In the arch of my foot, the shoe feels like I’m walking on something foreign. The shoe curves to my arch completely on the inside of the show. I have not figured out if I love this or not, but I have never had anything like it. The main issue is what it looks like when I pick up my foot, the material squished in an odd fashion in my dim picture. I know that all shoes bend on top, it just looked a bit cheap when it happened. I like them, I wear them often. The arch support is odd, the top bends weird, and the rubber sole is less than ideal; but I like them for the short period of time that I have had them."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2018",
      "text": "Bought this for my wonderful husband last Christmas and he loves it! We're not big gift-givers as we are happy with the simple things in life. My husband had a black leather wallet that was of the exact (or nearly) same configuration as this wallet, but not quite as high-quality. He carried that wallet for years, and a few of the pocket edges had worn quite thin. When he brought it to my attention that his wallet was wearing out, he expressed to me that two of his favorite features of his old wallet were that 1.) He could show his driver's license without removing it from his wallet or exposing his cash and credit cards and 2.) The \"flap\" or fold-over section flipped over the bill section, helping to prevent bills from falling out and also keeping his cash out of public view (not that he carries a huge wad or anything, but it's always best to be discreet with cash). We were not yet Amazon Prime members, and I proceeded to shop at a few stores for a replacement wallet. I found a few wallets that were similar, but the flap section didn't flip over the bill section, it flipped over the credit card pockets only, leaving the bills exposed, so those were a no-go. I'm not a big (in-store) shopper, and by the time I finally did find this beautiful wallet on Amazon, one of his old wallet pockets had broken and he was in real need of this item. I can't remember his old wallet now, but with this Tumi wallet, there are two card pockets that are exposed when he shows his license and four card pockets that remain hidden. He keeps his library card and membership cards in the exposed pockets and his credit cards in the hidden pockets. What he loves about this wallet: The configuration, which keeps his cash and cards secure and out of view. The size and slim profile of this wallet, which is comfortable in his pocket. The quality of construction. The simple profile and non-flashy logo. What I love about this wallet: The guy who carries it! It's been over a year, and we are very happy with this purchase. If you are considering this wallet, I hope you buy it and that you enjoy it as much as we have!"

Several occasions I looked for another L-Fold wallet as my wallet got older, but could not find one until I found the Tumi L-Fold wallet. Let me just say the photos don't do it justice. The ballistic nylon liner gives the wallet an extra feel of durability and quality. The leather is supple, but not flimsy, the stitching is perfect and the \"TUMI\" logo is small, black and subtle. I don't usually carry to many cards, but this will hold my license, plus seven cards in easy access slots. It also has two additional pockets to hold a few more cards if needed, but I hate bulky wallets so those are always empty. I like this wallet so much I gave a few away as Christmas presents this year and may do so again for birthdays this coming year..."

I have worn them with multiple types of shoes from tighter fitting shoes to looser shoes and they stay up. I have had them for a little over a month and they are still working as I hoped through multiple wears and washes. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a low/no show that will stay up."

      "text": "I am really picky about my no show sock liners. Comfort, non slip,cut just right. These are the best I have tried so far. Most sock liners are cut in a typical oval shape. These are cut differently. At first glance you might think the top will show in your shoes. They do not. They have a padded toe which I love and they are absorbent and slightly thicker than other brands which I like when working out. They are soft and comfortable. There is a generous clear no slip patch on the back and it works. I love these and eight pairs for the price is a steal. I highly recommend these."

      "text": "I decided to order these because i got a pair of canvas Keds sneakers for the summer, and needed some little socks to wear with them. I chose these ones based on the reviews, price, and cute colours. When they arrived, ill admit I was a bit disappointed at first. Right out of the package, they appeared to be way too thin, and the inside felt almost rough to the touch. HOWEVER... after the first wash, they came out beautifully! The fabric became totally soft and fluffy. Ive now had them about a month, theyve been worn and washed many times, and theyre holding up really well. Theyre just the perfect thickness for spring/summer/fall - thick and cushy enough to be comfy, but not hot or sweaty at all. The silicone grip at the back is genius, ive been wearing them daily with all different kinds of shoes and have never had a sock slip down. They stay exactly in the right spot on your foot all day, and you cant even feel the silicone patch against your skin. Theyre extremely comfy. I wear a wize 9.5 wide or extra wide shoe, and these socks fit my feet nicely. I would 100% recommend these socks to anyone, and ill definitely be buying more for myself."

      "text": "I really like these no-show socks! They have a durable, quality feel to them. The back of the socks have a rubber strip which helps the socks stay up, because them falling down is something annoying that happens with most no-show socks. Because they're a little on the thicker side, they might be too warm for summer weather, but overall, I'm really happy with these. I got them at a really good price too."

      "text": "The socks on their own are a comfortable fit, well made, cute and feel good. Unfortunately my main goal in getting this style was having the no-show cut stay put while wearing sneakers and runners, which these didn't live up to. :( Despite the non-slip heel lining that's built into the sock - sort of a silicone/rubbery thin bit on the inside of the sock near the back ankle interior - they slid down during my first and second wears, leading to nasty blisters from a very easygoing neighborhood walk. It also kind of seems like the silicone part made things worse... I got blisters from the shoe rub with no sock protection, and blisters further down on my heel where the silicone had slid. Definitely a bummer."

I usually fit in XL Tshirts, and these are a bit larger, so L fits me perfectly. I suggest ordering a size down if you are typically an XL. These shirts are a bit thicker than most Tshirts so they wear well, and shrink very little. Also, they aren't too short like so many Tshirts, they actually cover your backside when you sit down instead of ride up on you. The other thing I like is they cover your stomach without tension since they are roomy, so you don't look like you are wearing a skintight shirt. The pocket is a bonus."

And that's exactly what it looks like when you put it on. I ordered my usual size, but I dont think even sizing up would save me here. For those ladies that have a large chest, just face the music and move on. If your less fortified in the chest area, then this may be just perfect for you. The fact of the matter is, there is not enough length in the torso to actually cover your boobs and the peplum to reach your waist line. It hangs there like an awful bedskirt, ruffled around the largest circumference of your chest. Even if you size up, the torso length won't change significantly enough to make a difference. Super tight in chest, shoulder, and sleeves. Looks like a bedskirt."

I'm so glad I bought a 6, they fit her very well, even better than these Wonder Nation from Walmart. They do shrink some. The yellow is the wonder nation 4t/5t washed and dried with these new out of package underneath. These did shrink some, but just the right amount. I'm thankful for the price and the reviews that helped me choose the right size she can grow into. 👍🏻 We just got them so no reviews on how they holdup yet.

The tie in the front with the longer back is super nice for taller people like me. I have long arms and the sleeves fit well, right at my wrist. I do tend to like my sleeves a bit longer but this is perfectly fine. It’s a size large and I don’t think I would go any smaller. The material is a waffle knit, thicker than it looks in the picture so it’s not see through at all. I will be buying a few more of these in different colors given the fit and how easy it is to dress up or down."

It is so comfortable and soft but I decided to order another one in a pretty blue. I think I am going to have to get the green next lol. When I find something I really like I will buy it in different colors. I love leggings this is perfect because it’s long enough. The tie on it is meant to be tied not just taking pieces of the shirt. If you don’t like the tie on the front you won’t like the top. I also washed the wine one already and no shrinkage. Some people might want to wear another piece under it although you can’t really see through it"

So from what I read in reviews to go up on a size or 2 I ordered a S/M and it was a little big Im 4’11 and 130LB over all the costume is super cute and makes you look great I suggest going your original size . The leg warmers are super long so if your short it still won’t look too bad but won’t look like the model I just re order the smaller size and hopefully it will look even better over all great costume but not worth 40$ it was on sale for 30 but they changed it so now I paid 50$ but over all great costume better than party city"

I ordered a S/M I am 117 and 5’3 , although it is super cute it’s definitely long in the torso and the elastic around the thighs is too tight for someone like me who’s small and has a booty. I more than likely will be cutting the seams off. The leg warmers are also tight on the elastic part and pretty long so I will be wearing fishnets as an alternative."

Not sure if I missed a choice but mine is not cheeky it’s full coverage which isn’t ideal but that’s fine! The leg warmers suck. 1/5 bc the print is cool but the fit is awful. They make my thighs bulge like crazy and the garter length is halfway down my thighs, which is not where I want my skeleton bone legs to start.

I mean yeah sure you can wear the leg warmers but the kneecap part of the design is going to look real funky if it doesn't line up with your actual kneecaps. I'm 5'3 and I ended up just wearing the bodysuit and tossed the leg warmers. Like everyone else in the reviews said, the straps that connect to the leg warmers are too close to the crotch which makes it looks wonky if you try and wear you're own thigh highs. So yeah ..not worth the price for myself"

      "text": "The material is lightweight with a smooth natural feel. The 5% spandex gives it a very comfortable level of stretch so it never feels binding. Overall a very comfortable shirt with good quality. This would be a great shirt at $85, let alone the $25 price I paid. To give you insight into the fit, I am 5'8\", 145lbs with an athletic physique. I'm a size 40.5\" chest, 31\" waist (wear size 29\" in levi 501s), and 14.25\" bicep. I would normally buy a medium when getting a slim fit. However, I've been burned a few times when ordering on Amazon and the fit is not as describe, so I will look at the reviews, especially those with photos. There was a review/picture from a guy who is 5'71/2\", 150lbs, 31\" waist and describes himself as having broad shoulders. He bought a small, but In the picture it seem to be a loose fit. So then I saw a guy who is 5'11\", 176lbs, 42\" chest and 34\" waist and 14\" biceps. He bought a small and in the photo he looked similar to the model but not write as snug. This convinced me to buy a small. When I put it on, I looked similar to the model, though perhaps even a little tighter in the upper body. It was an extremely flattering fit. If I were in my 20's I would kept because you are expected to be 'showy' at that age. I, however, and 60 and I looked like an old guy trying to hard to impress. So I exchanged it for a medium. It still has a flattering sung fit in the upper body, but more age appropriate, though I would prefer it to be a bit slimmer in the waist for a more fitted look. Hope this helps. update: I just received a long-sleeved version. I tired it on and fit exactly like it appears on the model. I thought maybe they sent me a small by mistake so took it off and check the label, but it is a medium. It is not quite as snug as the short-sleeved small, so it is borderline 'age appropriate', so I decided to keep it. Anyway, I hope this helps you decide what size to order."

      "text": "I've had the WORST time finding actually-wide \"wide\" shoes after foot surgery. My only successes so far have been a couple (expensive) Merrells and (no-support, cheaply made) \"XW\" Easy Spirits. These have been the first tennis shoes I've been able to get my post-surgical foot into other than a pair of Merrell Moab Flights! They're just a hair too narrow for full comfort, but being that I got them for about half the price of the Merrells and my foot is still healing a bit, I'm going to keep them and they should fit better in another month or two. If you've been disappointed by way-too-narrow \"wide\" shoes like Asics, New Balance, or Columbia, these would be worth a try. If you need really wide shoes, try the tennis-shoe height Merrels like Moab Flight or Moab 2. Those are wider than these in the same size, but the mid-height Merrells seem to run a little more narrow. Other benefits: they look well made, have nice padding around the ankle, they're super lightweight, and they have a very supportive sole (can't be bent in half over the arch like cheaper shoes). There is a little arch support built in, but I'm replacing the insoles with orthotics for a little more support just with my foot structure. Recommended!"

I have been wearing Asics for probably 20 years but recently have noticed that the sizing is off and the support not as good for moderately priced (under $80) sneakers. I used to be a 7.5 in Asics and could always buy that size and know they'd be fine. My last pair were bought almost 2 years ago and they were an 8.5, which I know I am NOT. But the 7.5 and 8s, my toes were hitting the front. I even recently tried a pair of Adidas, but returned them too (they didn't feel substantial enough, I can't really explain it - but they were the PureBoost Xpose). So given that it's been a 2 year journey for a sneaker that fits and feels comfortable, I am finally content. I am a walker, not a runner, but these will be fine. My only concern is that because the upper material feels like cotton, I worry that they will wear out faster. We'll see"

For context, these are not for running but I do spend most of my work shifts (8+ hours) on my feet. If you're familiar with Nike Tanjuns they would kind of remind you of these but they feel sturdier and they're a bit heavier. This model has a narrower toebox than my gel-ventures (which I actually prefer) and they truly fit like a glove. Some people have written that they orderd down a size... as for me, I've always worn a 7.5 in Asics and these fit true to my size in that regard. Would definitely recommend checking these out!"

With the combination of the shoes and the inserts, my feet don't hurt at all after working a very long shift. The inserts may not be needed if these are strict gym or running shoes, but being on your feet for long hours, the inserts are very much needed. I love how the tops of the shoe are fabric, thus allowing your toes and feet to move freely. I would totally buy another pair of these for my gym shoes. Great shoe for the price!!!!"

Good style with enough arch support and cushioning for true comfort and not feeling every speck of gravel you might step on. Very good price for a shoe of this comfort level. However, this shoe didn't provide enough support along the outer edge for my problem with supination that resulted from a broken ankle and surgery a few years ago. I don't think this would be a good shoe for supinators in general. The Brooks Glycerin offers much better support for this issue, but it also costs a lot more. I would've loved the Asics Torrance otherwise."

And I think cloth shoes are becoming more of the style I guess. I usually wear a size 8 or 8.5. I got these in 8B(M) and they fit well (might be snug for the wide footed).

But, after doing housework in them, I pitch them in the hamper and use a clean one that night. I don't even mind answering the door with these on, as they don't look particularly like pj's. They are very comfortable and not restrictive. I guess that would depend on your size, of course. These say they are one size fits all but I think they run large. If you are a size 10 or under, they will swallow you! Use laundry soften when you wash them because they are a little rough. I am sure a few more washings will take care of that. Surprisingly, the red one didn't run in the wash."

      "text": "This is difficult, and I will update once washed...size is equivalent to my WASHED AND DRIED 2X-3X from Walmart or Superstore, but the material is thicker, and there is no annoying picture/logo on it. At the shoulder, width is about 23 inches (59 cm) from sleeve seam to sleeve seam; hem width is about 26 inches (65cm) across - very little flare to accommodate hips; length is 40 inches (100 cm) measure from back collar to hem. As mentioned by others, this is VERY close fitting at the throat. I really want to like this, but I really don't like tight fitting, and it lacks the flare (an extra 6 inches width at the hem with the others in my drawer...) I would prefer. Update Oct 2020: after warm water washing and tumble drying it lost a minor bit in length (less than an inch) but gained it in width, lessening the tight feel. This has vastly improved the feel and fit - although the neck is still a bit on the snug side. Material is quite heavy for this sort of shirt, at least double the thickness of normal Walmart T-shirt style night shirt. I have upgraded from three to four stars based on softening, widening, and wear - it still looks new."

They arrived quickly, great color, perfect size, great quality 100% cotton, and hardly shrunk when washed!

In Europe they used to wear gemstones according to the month of birth at the beginning of the 15th century. It goes further back in time to the Biblical story of the 12 Breastplate Stones. Birthstones are used as an Amulet of Healing Power that brings Luck, Protection, Good Health, Fertility, Purity, Happiness and Strength.

Avoid direct contact with perfumes, body washes, lotions and excessive sweating. Don't expose to the sun or avoid high temperature. Clean jewelry with a soft cloth before putting away.

I looked at Amazon's size chart rather than the one listed in the description, though they're not too different. The pink color is more of a warm-toned pastel/baby pink whereas I feel the posted pictures looked like it might be a bit darker or cooler-toned. Overall the material feels good, but it is a little see-through (but easily fixed as long as you don't wear anything dark underneath). The sleeves were also a bit long, but I'm petite so I'm not surprised. I plan to cut the sleeves in the future to make it sleeveless though, so it doesn't matter much to me."

The color isn't exactly the same as the photo, it's more of a bright peachy pastel kind of pink (which I don't mind because it's actually the perfect shade for me). The material is stretchy and the length lands above the knees but not too short where I can't bend. There's also a lot of neck room so it doesn't feel suffocating.

For the photo shoot I wish I had sized to the 6/7 as it was a tad big for her around and in length but she loved that it was dragging a bit “like a princess.” She loved holding it up and twirling. For wearing this “rainbow princess dress” (as she calls it) again and again as she wants to, I’m glad I ordered the 7/8. I washed and machine dried it before the session and it help up well. I pulled it while it was still slightly damp to allow it to hang dry the rest of the way because I was scared it would wrinkle but even with her rolling around a bit it did not."

The material is thin so I can see already that this is going to be a very delicate process every time I wear them. I hope I just lose about two or 3 pounds so I can just pull them up without even opening the grommet at the waist. Because if you open and close that grommet many times it will just tear right through the fabric. But they are figure flattering and a very nice material that is lightweight. That grommet is the only problem that I see. It would behoove them to put a A button or the snap like the old Levi’s pants with a button hole and a grommet button. But not this."

I read reviews that said to go with the a bigger size. I usually wear a 14 so ordered a 16 and they fit perfectly! I never thought I could order pants online and have them fit so great. I live in my lululemons in the summer but wanted something to wear I could dress up just slightly and these are perfect. They have a little stretch which makes them comfortable but not enough stretch that they will bag out and fall down. The waist has a stretchy elastic waistband and is very comfortable as well. My waist is 34” for reference I also have wide calf’s and these aren’t too tight around them. I’m in love with the fit for my curves!"

      "text": "This is a cute little casual watch that I love wearing. I am so pleased that I was able to adjust the wrist band on my own. It's just a matter of using a very small Allen wrench or a thin metal tool that you insert into the opening of the clasp where the arrow is located. Lift up and slide the clasp to your suiting. Then press very hard to close up the clasp. I didn't figure this out on my own, I went to You Tube to teach me! So if you need to see a video lesson then go to You Tube and search \"How to adjust a Casio side clasp\" and the video by The Watch Hut will come up. The video is short and sweet and easy to understand even for someone like me who is not mechanically minded. Also I went to You Tube to learn how to set the time and calendar. You can find this video by searching for \"How to set time Casio LA670W\" by Yzmael Official. Again, for someone like me who gets easily frustrated with this sort of thing, the instructions were clear enough for me and it wasn't even in the English language!"

Although I bought this watch with the intention of it being a backup, it ended up becoming the watch I use daily.

Too bad, because I really like them. Great for mild winters (-3). Anything colder, might not be suitable. Great little pair of boots. They are half size too big, but if you wear thick socks it works out great. Overall, warm, non-slippery and great on snow! Super comfortable. Love them so far."

      "text": "This is my second or third round of buying leggings from Leggings Depot! I love them so much every time. I'm a size 12 and the one size-plus fits perfect. I'm going to list all the reasons these are emy favorite to date: 1) they are long but don't bunch up at the ankle like other leggings on short legs. I had so many issues finding leggings that would fit but would not bunch at the ankle because I'm on the shorter side so I could wear them under shoes/boots. These are long so there is enough fabric to stay under the boot but also the fabric is thin enough that there is no bunching. These are perfect for the knee high or ankle boot look. 2) They are soft, stretchy, and the band is not abrasive. Im very sensitive to material feeling. These are so soft and delicate feeling. They are quite thin which may be a downside for some but it lets you layer them in the winter easily. I wear them under long shirts, sweaters, dresses and other pants/skirts so it's not much of an issue for me. I never see my skin through darker colors but you may want to be aware of the thiness just in case you intend on bending a lot and don't have booty coverage. The band (especially the wider style band) doesn't cut into your stomach like others might. The wider band style especially doesn't leave me feeling like a sausage link. It doesn't provide a lot of support but for me, this is a plus as it doesn't trigger sensitivity issues I have in the abdominal region. Also they somehow managed to make a product with enough stretch that it can perfectly hug every curve in the leg without it looking too stretched out in the thigh. This is a rare delight. 3) They are so affordable. It's so hard to find clothes that check all the boxes. But I always come back here when I need leggings. I buy them a few at a time. And just replaced my last ones that were wearing out after a couple years when they were on sale recently. These are a staple in my wardrobe and I will definitely be back for more when I can!"

I am only 5 ft. tall so they are long on me but I just bunch them a little at the ankle which to me doesn't look bad at all. Also I will sometimes wear them inside boots. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 only because they are not thick at all and won't keep your legs warm. I live in the deep south and so it's too hot to wear leggings in late spring and summer, so these will be a fall item for me. I was hoping these would be thicker. But the price and the buttery feel and the color make them a definite keeper for me."

The only thing I would note is to wash them the first time with darks, as they ran a bit. That didn't affect their color, however."

      "text": "My Height: 5' 5\" My Weight: 110 lbs Size: Small Style/Color: Yoga Capri White Leggings are a staple item in my wardrobe -- worn alone with t-shirts or under dresses, sweaters, long tops, flirty shorts and rompers, etc. I can't survive without them, and white or ivory are staple colors in summer. I've been looking for 2 years for a replacement pair, and because of Covid restrictions, and long quarantine here in L.A., I haven't been to a mall since December 2019. Ugh. My favorite legging store has been just out of reach, and you all know how hard it is to order online, let alone deal with sizing. None of the leggings offerings on Amazon were what I was looking for, until I spotted these ... There are workout/yoga/running leggings for \"sport\" which are thicker and very different than fashion leggings. It's hard to tell online sometimes which is being offered. I've been fooled several times in the past, but not this time. The leggings I chose in YOGA CAPRI WHITE is EXACTLY what I was looking for. They're thin, soft and supple, but all the leggings on this site are not the same style/material/cut. The one I got is buttery smooth and soft, and too sheer to wear with or without panties. You might as well be naked if you try. These leggings are great for wearing something over them that covers the lower torso, whether it's a top, sweater, hoodie, dress, skirt, etc. I noticed the photo of one reviewer wearing her leggings without panties and you could see RIGHT THROUGH THE LEGGINGS from behind. EVERYTHING. If we could still comment on reviews, I would have warned her to take it down. Perhaps you can see what I mean in my photo with my hand underneath the legging. Most thin, American leggings are made of nylon and a little spandex, while these leggings are POLYESTER and a little spandex. The weave is smoother and tighter, very buttery soft (not quite as breathable as the nylon) and about as stretchy. There's a wide but thin tummy control band at the top, which I prefer to gathered elastic waistband of the other legging style in this offering. The stitching is mostly great (French seams where needed), even though the hem at the bottom of the legs took a shortcut on the side seam. It's just cut material, but can't be seen from the outside. These leggings fit me great. They look exactly like I wanted them to look, and like they appeared online. No complaints about the thin, smooth, soft material either. I don't know how durable they'll be as the laundering instructions recommend hand washing. That's okay with me. Hang dry doesn't take long, and the price -- on sale when I ordered them -- is even better. I can't speak for any other style or color, but this one was EXACTLY what I was looking for. FYI: If you buy a smaller size than you actually need, the thin leggings will look even more sheer. 5 stars for being the look I wanted, but only 4 stars for some reservations about long-term stretch of the polyester material and durability."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2017",
      "text": "This is a great undershirt for anyone who wants to avoid sweatmarks! Note that I have worn this shirt twice, and washed it--as per the care instructions--in my washer/dryer in between. Accordingly, I can't speak to longevity over a period of months, but can discuss the effect of a wash. The highlights: Pros: 1. Truly sweatproof. I recently wore this under my suit to a cocktail-attire event that seemed to lack air conditioning. Everyone complained about how hot it was. I could feel myself sweating and--even though I had this shirt on--was worried that it would show. Not at all! I even double checked when I got home: no sweatmarks, no damp feeling, and (courtesy of a good ol' fashioned sniff test) no smell. 2. The deep V collar keeps it truly hidden. When not wearing a tie, I typically like to keep the top two buttons on my button-ups unbottoned. Even with V-neck undershirts, the undershirt can sometime make an unwanted appearance. This shirt does not have that problem and stays hidden. 3. Similar to #2, the streamlined fit means that even with a tailored- or slim-fit dress shirt, this undershirt doesn't create any added bulk. At the same time, the elastic material used in the shirt is not constrictingly form fitting. 4. Seems to hold up after washing. I waited to write a review until I had used the shirt again after washing. Following the care instructions, the wash did not seem to have a negative impact on the shirt. Cons (sort of...): 1. If wearing this with a white dress shirt, there is a chance that the outline will be visible under your shirt (this depends on how thin the dress shirt is). This is the case with one of my white dress shirts, but it is very minor and--especially when wearing a jacket--I don't think others tend to notice. 2. The material in the under-arms has a weird feeling when first wearing the shirt that you have to get used to. It feels a little bulky in that area, but this seems to be a doubly-thick material to make sure that sweat doesn't soak through. And (see #1 in the Pros above) it does it's job. Once you get fully dressed and start going about your day, it really isn't too noticeable. Overall, for someone who sweats a lot--particularly under arms, this shirt is a lifesaver for dress events!"

      "text": "One of the best products I've ever discovered. I sweat excessively, and for years I worried about sweating through shirts at the office or when giving presentations and relegated myself to dark shirts on weekends that wouldn't show underarm wetness. I was always self conscious about raising my arms, and I ruined many nice shirts with anti-antiperspirant buildup. Coffee, hot days, social situations etc. were not my friends... After discovering Ejis a few years ago, my life really changed for the better. Now, I simply wear a regular v-neck during the week and a deep v-neck on the weekend, and my shirts and underarms stay completely dry and clean. I actually stopped wearing antiperspirant and switched to just deodorant because antiperspirant is unnecessary. I've never once sweated through the Ejis shirts. At first I was a little unsure of the modal fabric, but I've grown to appreciate its cool silky feel and stretchy fit. These shirts are fairly expensive, but it's a small price to pay to never have to worry about underarm wetness and stains again. Plus, it's probably saved me money as I don't have to replace my shirts as often, and I get to wear my favorite shirts more frequently without worrying about ruining them. I'm really happy this product exists, and I hope it works as well for other excessive sweaters as it has for me. The shirts have really improved my life."

Not only does this shirt solve the problem of looking ridicules when you're covered in sweat in the middle of December, it also saves a a lot of money by making your dress shirts last a lot longer. I had tried other brands that make similar products but was never happy with how bulky they looked. The Ejis shirt fits like a compression shirt and is so stretchy that it wont effect mobility. The underarm pads took a minute to get use to but I very quickly forgot they were even there. If the price is an issue I would remind you to consider how many nice shirts you have thrown away because of armpit stains! This product eliminates that problem completely. I would strongly recommend buying at least two because they do need to be washed often."

I can wear any colour of shirt without having that anxiety of sweating through it. The boost in confidence is worth the cost. And honestly it's not much more than what you'd spend on a regular t shirt or shirt. Plus it will protect your expensive shirts, making them last longer. Do buy a size down as other people have said. If you want to wear short sleeve shirts, it's harder to hide but doable with relaxed sleeves.

She doesn't complain, but they look a bit tight and the velcro closure is almost too small, and her feet are not wide or chunky, so it's not that! If she decides to continue dancing, I'll just size up, because the brand does seem to be really good quality."

      "text": "I read through all of the reviews before purchasing these tap shoes. Many people noted that the shoes ran very small and to go up 1 to 2 sizes. People even noted that going up 1.5 sizes were a perfect fit, with no room to grow. I printed off a shoe size measuring foot from Amazon and measured my 3 year old daughter and then went up 2 sizes since my daughter actually will not be taking a tap class until summer, but she wanted a pair of tap shoes to practice/play in now. She was an 8.5 per my measurement. I ordered a 10.5 medium. These are waaay too big for her. You can see the cracks of her toes and her toes almost look like they are going to come out the top of the shoe. I worry about her twisting her ankle in the shoes since they are too big and tap shoes can be slippery, especially on our ceramic tile floor. It is also very difficult for her to tap in them because she cannot bend her foot since they are so large. She wants to wear them, so I really have to tighten the Velcro strap down. She will grow into them eventually, but I am going to purchase another pair 1 size smaller (which is 1 size up from her measured foot size), which I anticipate will still be a little big according to how big this pair is, but with some room to grow. She is petite and does not have \"thick\" feet, so I went with the medium and they seem fine width wise. I normally do not like to buy shoes online because it is so hard to get the fit right the first time. I did order these online for a couple of reasons: 1. They were so much cheaper than ordering directly from Capezio ($42) 2. Our closest dance store is approx. 30 minutes away and they tried to tell me that this shoe is not made in black patent leather, despite me telling them that they are and that I had seen them on both Amazon and the Capezio website. They told me that they had the tan and they were the same price as the Capezio website. I considered going over there just to try the tan on for sizing, but who knows if they would have had medium and wide width and several sizes in stock. I would definitely purchase these shoes again. I love the Velcro strap as my daughter can easily put them on herself. If you have a dance store near to your home, I would take a trip over and try them on for size since it seems like the reviews are all over the board, unless you don't mind making returns. In our case, I could have purchased her current shoe size and they would have probably been a perfect fit, but with little growing room. I would recommend going up 1 size per our experience."

I know it says to “spot clean”, but I’ve always washed ALL my shoes/slippers in the washer (if they fall apart, I just don’t buy them again~ so user beware 😏). I put the main slipper parts (felt/rubbery bottom part) in my large lingerie bag and the insoles (the fleece/cork-rubbery sole) in my small lingerie bag (both zip completely and kind of lock- although my insoles were out of the bag at the end- no damage though)- washed on delicate/light load, cold. They look brand new! (I’m really hard on shoes and I don’t wear socks with these typically because they are so warm 😊♥️). No damage to the slippers- but it does recommend to spot clean- NOT IN THE WASHER! Like I said, I always do on delicate and in cold water- AT MY OWN RISK. Just putting this out there for anyone else contemplating washing. I bought my lingerie bags on Amazon awhile ago- but I use them for a LOT of things. After I’ve worn headbands and/ or my ponytail holders a few times, I have a smallish lingerie bag in my bathroom and throw them in it- once I see my ponytail holders and/or headbands- cloth- are getting low, I throw them in the wash to get any oils from my hair off- good as new! Just an FYI for anyone that tends to throw the hair ties out after a few uses or never thought of washing them… I was tired of buying them all the time, not expensive, but it adds up… As far as the slippers go, I washed mine like I said above- it’s a buyer-beware kind of thing though, because it does say NOT to put them in the wash. Mine look brand new! I wouldn’t wash them without lingerie bags though as it keeps everything together and not jumbling around the washer, banging against the sides without a little protection. I AM IN LOVE WITH THESE HOUSE SLIPPERS😊♥️😊 I’m probably going to order one, maybe two, more pairs because I know in a couple of years when I’ll need a new pair they won’t be available ♥️"

      "text": "These slippers fit and feel exactly like every other 'real' Birkenstock since 1774. The Italian made wool may feel a bit scratchy or tight on the first wear however, it adjusts and conforms to the foot quickly. Wearing a thin sock can help cut that adjustment period. Being wool, it's water-repellant/water-proof (which also applies to coffee/tea for the half-awake in the kitchen type people who tend to spill their morning cup). The inner sole lining is REAL fur (from New Zealand) , not synthetic. It feels wonderful and nicely fills in any gaps not supported by the Birkie footbed - assuming that the wearer puts it on properly. It is not overly warm ( a plus for those with sweaty feet) yet does a great job at keeping cold feet comfortable. The latex sole is very supportive and flexible. It does not slip on smooth floors and is Lego-proof. The cork footbed provides solid support, not the pillow-like squish that goes flat in a couple of days. Yes, they can be worn outside (but shopping or long walks should be done in street shoes, not slippers). Another big plus is that they are not overly large, cushy, or otherwise oddly shaped so as to look like marshmallows on the feet, don't make walking difficult, don't prevent 'tucking a leg', don't get stuck under cabinets/furniture. Well cared for, like all other Birkie's, there's no reason to think these slippers will not last for many years. Pros: Everything above. Con: Red was Out of Stock in my size."

Since I work from home, I wear slippers A LOT so it's important to me that they meet my needs. I've tried other supportive slippers but they're so heavy and clunky that it just feels like wearing shoes. I've also gotten ones out of manmade fabrics that my feet sweat in (sorry for putting that picture in your head!). These ones are wool so they keep my feet at a comfortable temperature. They provide the support of Birkies with a much thinner and lighter sole. You could wear them outside but my guess is they wouldn't last long because of the thinner sole. These are really house slippers. If I had one suggestion, it would be to add a little more cushioning to the insole but really they're very comfortable and work well for me."

I paired them with a cami for when I started going back to the office and they work just as well in that setting. Then they wound up being the perfect dresses to wear during my maternity leave because they are comfy and easy to nurse and pump in. Can't recommend them enough."

The neckline is quite deep but i just wear a vest underneath and that solves that problem. This dress is ideal for breastfeeding as the top overlaps easily pull to the side and I could see this being useful as a maternity dress too due to the stretchy waistband and flowing skirt. Overall a worthwhile purchase and I definitely recommend."

The fabric cells have enough give to them that you can get away with overstuffing some cells and understuffing others. My only complaint is that I can't buy the individual modules separately. For example, I want more of the 8- and 6-cell bins (they're great for storing T-shirts), but I don't need more of the 3-cell bins (I keep my bras on hangers and nothing else fits well in these). I ordered two sets. Here's how I ended up using them: 24-cell bins: I use these for underwear (1-2 pairs per cell) and socks (1-2 pairs per cell). 8-cell bins: I use these for T-shirts (fold and roll into a short tube, stick into the cell). 6-cell bins: I use these for storing T-shirts (fold into small rectangle) or shorts (fold once and stick inside). 3-cell bins: I don't have a good use for these. Right now one is empty and the other has some pajamas in it. The cells are just too big and floppy to be useful for much."

The smallest squares fit 2 onesies per square when rolled up. The larger squares fit 2 pairs of pants per square when rolled up. I use the larger rectangular bin for holding diapers (both disposable and prefolds fit like a champ when stood vertically - I fold the prefolds in half to get them to stand), and the smaller rectangles are perfect for little items like socks and mittens. It's simple to find what I'm looking for and the tiny clothes don't end up lost in a giant pile in the drawer! The quality is quite good for the price and I like that the inner pieces of fabric are flexible as this allows me to better fit the items."

I finally decided to get a new pair and these are not at all the same shoes. They may look the same, but that's where the similarities end. The new pair are not the same size, the materials are cheap, and I don't think they're going to last more than a year or two. For ordinary shoes a year or two might be fine, but for tevas I certainly expected more. The straps are made of really thin ribbon instead of sturdy canvas like material. The plastic pieces that hold the straps look like they could snap any minute. The soles are stiff and don't move with the foot. I hope they soften up with time. I recently bought a much cheaper pair of sandals on Amazon for under $20 and they are made of much higher quality materials than these. I tend to reach for those much more often than these junkie tevas. I also wear my beat up old ones because they just feel great. I'm so disappointed because I really just want the same shoes I already had, but a newer version. Unfortunately, they don't exist."

Was pleasantly surprised to return from a 100 minute country walk quite early on and before properly breaking them in, without a single blister. In fact, these are fast becoming my 'heavy duty' sandals. A size 5 does feel a trifle wide and large, (am 4.5 - 5) but better than having feet spilling out. Further, having flat feet, I like it that the foot is well-supported. It's always good to alternate shoes, but these are definitely a useful addition to my collection."

The Velcro wasn’t long enough to tighten over one of my feet and hence sticking out, vulnerable to catch anything. I returned it promptly. This pair from a different seller was much better. I am totally happy with it. I would advise that with the right size your arches would site nicely on the mount, leaving just enough space at both ends of your feet. I’m not sure you can go walking whole day in these but I love the design and the arch support, not too high, is just right for me."

If I put this on his pants at night, he puts his pants on like normal during day and only has his pant button to contend with. It works! I’ve read other reviews and I think people confuse how it is intended to work. You don’t snap each end to each other in front. You thread through the loops and on the last loop you fold the end back over the loop and snap it to the snap next to it. The front part of your pant area, the button and zipper area should be clear and open, no belt covering it. It’s genius in it’s simplicity."

Fit pretty well it felt a little larger than I had expected im a size 13 it felt kinda like a 13 1/2. 2. Crazy comfortable on the bottom of my foot. The sandal band is a little tight and ridged right now but they’re brand new and aren’t broken In yet so I expect that to pass. 3. Feels very high quality leagues above any rubber flip flop I’ve had. These don’t feel like they will break at all and since they don’t have that dumb strap going through to the bottom you don’t have to worry about that breaking 4. Price, I got these on sale for around $20, we’ll worth the money and I’m honestly considering getting another pair so I can have indoor and outdoor sandals(we have cats the hair gets on your feet). But I would probably have paid up to $25-30 and would have been happy with them"

I wore them as shower sandals in the gym, around the garden, to the pool, to the beach - they were almost indestructible. Finally the thong part detached after about 15 years of hard wear and tear. I couldn't find the exact replacement, so I wound up choosing these. I have to say, these are definitely more stylish-looking, but have same durable feel and have held up really well so far! I am a happy customer. I have been wearing to the beach, getting all sandy & wet - a quick rinse and they look brand-new still. Highly recommend for anyone needing a more durable sandal that can handle any condition but not look like you have Forrest Gump shoes, lol."

      "text": "While this is really cute, the fabric is as pictured, and an overall good value, it has a slight issue with the cut. The neck is a little large, and the sleeves are these slots that you put your arm through, only they have these open slits from elbow to wrist, which makes it sort of ... weird. The sleeves are not true sleeves, but rather sewn to the body of the garment. They look ok, but the design is a bit strange. This works well as a casual cover up, or even for an overlay for work if you have the right kind of shirt underneath (camisoles look weird as the fabric is thin, but a short sleeved t-shirt looks ok). If the neck was cut better and the sleeves more like a true sleeve, it would easily be a 5 star item. Overall minus 1 star for sleeve issue."

It would though look good on a more generous size, as it's very roomy. The fabric is very sheer so a T shirt underneath is needed. It's lovely and floaty, well made and a very pretty pattern. The background is black, and the flower clusters which I thought looked peach are in fact a neutral colour. They match my Nude shoes perfectly if that's any help! I've tried it with a black maxi skirt and the nude shoes. Very pleased with result"

Something that can be by itself in summer or with a cardigan in winter. This is definitely that. Only complaint is the chest. I'm 6' 2\", 205 lb, size 12-14 in tops. 36DD. I finally stopped ordering XL's when I was tired of my body being lost in all my clothes. I got this in a large and I had to wear my small-boobs bra to get it to fit. There is no stretch at all, but thankfully there's a button in the back because I did my make-up before I put the shirt on and it almost got gnarly. I don't love my arms, especially in some short-sleeved shirts. But I would probably wear this without a cardigan. For a shirt that's not supposed to be fitted, it flows pretty well with my movements. It hints at the fact that I might have curves, which I like. If you're even slightly more in-between sizes, you may need to order up or pass on this one. And if you're a 36DD or higher, you may need an XL."

Usually I just place my sunglasses in the arm rests of my vehicle, albeit unprotected, so now they won’t be.

      "text": "All three came clams open, stacked and felt very flimsy. But when zipped up they are sturdy. The only issue I have with these are the zipper. They are stiff, not smooth at all. Only loose or soft area of these cases are the zipper material. Otherwise when clams are closed these cases are rigid. Plenty of space. Best suited for wrap around sunglasses with neck straps (any size) attached. Too big for reading glasses as it would move around in the case, with a rattle. One minus star for the poor zipper.

First time I put them on they were a little snug. I played a round with them and have to say, they stretch and adjust to your feet, are fully supported inside and are now one of my favs. They are like a golf glove for your feet! So comfortable and make every round I play in them that much more enjoyable. One recommendation... don't lace them tight... buy the right size and the laces won't have to do much as they fit on your foot like a sock. Try them and I have no doubt, you will be as big a fan as I am...Like walking on a supportive cloud... Thanks Puma... I am difficult to win over as a fan for golf shoes... but these are winners!"

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2021",
      "text": "UPDATE: Unfortunately (and despite my early experience of staying dry), The last few rounds I played the mesh was no longer water proof and my socks were very wet about 3 holes into the round (especially in the toe area). This was not golf in the rain, the course was just wet from the night before. Too bad... I still wear these shoes around town as they are comfortable and I like the way they look. Other than the dryness issue, I like they way they perform on the course too. Oh well... you get what you pay for. -1 star from original of 4 stars. ORINGINAL REVIEW: I was going to wait a little while to review these shoes because of the previous questionable reviews. However, yesterday sealed the deal for me! Granted I only have about 10 rounds of golf on these so longevity is YTBD, but yesterday I played in the rain and mud with these shoes after a day when my area received 3.5\" of rain the day before. The course was Muddy and WET and I was concerned that these shoes, being less expensive then some of the best reviewed, might not hold up. Not only were my socks and feet bone dry at the end of the round but my feet felt great! They shed water like a champ and even though they are spikeless, I felt no slippage on any shot (tee box or fairway). From other reviews, it looks like there is a tendency for the laces to rip through the leather eyelets. I have been weary of that so the first few rounds I was \"careful\" not to pull too hard but the last few rounds I've been testing them a little more for durability. So far, no problem. Anyway, I try to leave reviews that help other consumers so here are the pros and cons readers digest version. This is one mans opinion, YMMV. The golfer leaving the review: *Male - 6'2\" - 185lbs - size 12 medium *Mid 50's *Golf 3-5 times a week (12 Handicap) * Has owned numerous golf shoes from FootJoy and other well known brands. Pros *Comfortable (like, super-wear-all-day-type-comfortable) *Good looking if you like the sneaker vibe *so far, appear to do well in wet weather (UPDATE: 2 months in they are leaking!) *nice and cool on hot days *flexible upper mesh (see cons for same feature) *spikeless sole has provided good stability *fits this golfer's narrow foot but feels like it could be comfortable for wider fits. Cons *Still concerned about eyelets ripping (will report here if so) *May not provide great side to side stability for some golfers (Mesh upper not the same as shoes with leather upper) *Spikeless sole not an aggressive tread - aggressive golfers with faster swing speeds than I, may have issues. For $90.00 (and if the eyelets don't break) this is a great value in a golf shoe. Took off one star only for the stability factor."

      "text": "I’m on my third pair in a month and have FINALLY learned my lesson. Yes, there is a horrible design flaw with the eyelets for the laces. Thin rubber doesn’t hold up when pulling the laces tight and so many reviews including this one show the fatal flaw. BUT, it can be avoided! I didn’t want to give up since this shoe was more comfortable than the previous six I tried on. So, for my third pair, after “the rip” occurred twice, I decided to poke holes through the eyelets and through the shoe material to match the top eyelet which was designed this way. The problem was solved and takes less than 10 minutes. I used a very small Phillips head screwdriver to poke the holes all the way through the shoe material, and re-laced the shoe. Now I get to enjoy the comfort of this shoe without having to worry about ripping the rubber for a third time. Don’t give up on this shoe!"

It looks great on the feet but the best thing about it is the performance. Right away my husband noticed tremendous improvement with his golfing.

      "text": "These are possibly the best golf shoes ive ever worn, amazing fit, great support and no waterproof issues. However on the second time I put them on the rubber/plastic lace hole completely ripped through as I was lacing them up. Fair to say I dont lace my shoes up hard so i was really dissappointed as i thought i'd found the shoes I'd wear forever (was looking to buy a second pair last night). I'd be really appreciative if the seller or Amazon would help me out here as I presume this is a manufacturing issue. --Adding an edit While it was disappointing that the construction of the shoes relied upon the plastic eyelit for the shoelace a very simple fix was achieved by putting a hole in the material below it. As a regular user of Amazon they were highly supportive and helped me. Once again - these shoes are absolutely fantastic, I have long narrow feet and the reduction in pain even playing 2 rounds in a day were noticeable. I hope that my experience isnt shared.

      "text": "Oh my gosh, this skirt is ADORABLE, so comfortable, twirly, and much nicer quality than I was expecting! It is so cute and fun to wear - I felt like a little kid in a twirly tutu all day and wanted to dance around and spin in circles! I love the mid-calf length (I’m 5’4”, around 110 pounds, and ordered a small) and it could be shorter or longer by placing the extra-comfy elastic waistband higher or lower or even cutting the outside layer of tulle the same length as the skirt liner (which is maybe 2” shorter than the tulle). I wore this down low on my waist for a formal choral concert to have the longer length, but it was comfortable no matter where I put the waistband. I love that the waistband is wider and lays flat and smooth the whole time I was wearing the skirt. The only downside was it was a bit hard to get the wrinkles out of the skirt liner from shipping (warm iron - not hot or it could melt - and WET it with water before trying to iron! I bet a steamer would have worked perfectly if I had planned ahead!) and it was a bit staticky from the plastic shipping bag, but spraying it with Static Guard took care of it and the static never returned (worn twice so far). I really love this skirt and will get a lot of wear out of it, despite only ordering it with the plan to wear for one choir concert and not care if it fell apart. I’ll hand-wash it to make it last because now I love it! I had so many compliments on this skirt! Nobody could believe how inexpensive it was or that I got it from Amazon! I sent all the old church ladies into a tizzy when I divulged the cost and “boutique” from which it came! 😁"

I want you to know that you can totally customize this skirt. If you like a lot of poof then wear it as it comes. To take the poof down a notch cut out one layer of tulle. To almost totally de-poof you can cut/remove both middle layers of tulle. Its really easy to do this (just lift up the outer layer and cut away, no sewing experience needed). You can use this for Halloween, informal days, formal events, whatever. I have a big tummy and a decent sized tush, but I wear this skirt in a size small. Don't ask me how, I have no idea because I always wear an L or XL in most clothes. I suppose that waist is so stretchy it just doesn't matter. Don't hesitate on this skirt. It's a great value and the quality is admirable at the price. The packaging is decent as well as the skirt doesn't come totally wrinkled. Just use a steamer if you have one to release the few wrinkles or mist it with water and put it in the dryer it with a towel on a very very low setting. Enjoy your special look, I know you'll look darling!"

They help cover up while maintaining a modern style. Bikinis are super versatile and flatter all body types, making them a good option for most easy, breezy outfits. Illumination Hi Cut Hi-Cut panties are a mix between Bikinis and Briefs, providing more coverage than a Bikini at the tummy and back but not quite as much as a Brief. Hi-Cut panties also sit higher up on the thigh which makes your legs look longer. Hi-Cut panties are a perfect partner for high-waisted pants and skirts. Illumination Brief Briefs offer the most all-around coverage. Designed for comfort and fit above all else, they usually sit higher on the waist. They have a simple silhouette and typically come in soft fabrics like cotton, nylon, or microfiber. Briefs are a great no-show option to wear under clothing that skims and glides, like dresses and skirts. Illumination Hipster Hipsters are most like a Bikini, but they offer slightly more coverage with wider sides and lower cut legs. Hipsters also tend to have a low rise, sitting just below the waist which makes them a great option for low-rise jeans and pants. Read more ",

These underwear you buy on Amazon are made in Honduras whereas the ones you buy at Khol's are made in Bangladesh. The ones made in Honduras seem to have a different much less durable elastic that after just a few washes starts to desintegrate and come out of the underwear. The blue colors also seem to darken and look ugly and dirty over time. Would not recommend."

I like to have the material hug my shape, a wedged look, and not the style which has the material that just covers your behind and does not sink in to show your shape. The cut on this for bubbly shapes is perfect. Sits and conforms nicely on the curvature of hips and comes down just far enough so that if you ever bend over you'll never show you are wearing a cheeky pair of briefs. Yes, they are cheeky, meaning you show about 1/3 or more of your butt. They are sexy as hell and stylish. The pouch in front was large enough to keep the valuables in place without being too tight. I am a shapely, in shape 30\" waist. The large (Chinese sizes) is a little larger than I have normally felt in my other thong and cheeky briefs. But it fits well enough so I am not returning. Really, really comfortable. You'll love the look, and so will anyone else, especially if you have a bubble behind."

I’ve got a bigger butt and the Brazilian cut looks a little too feminine the way it covers only half my cheeks (which I knew from the description). It almost looks like I’m wearing my wife’s underwear, so for that reason I’m not going to wear these much if at all. It’s too bad because I like everything else about them and the price is a good value. This is not a knock against the product, just a note for those considering it.

I needed a light weight rain jacket for rainy, hot, humid weather that I could also throw in the back of a rental car and grab when I needed it. I also used it for watching the Chincoteague Pony Swim which was RAINY this year. The jacket was perfect! The hood was well proportioned, great front pockets, the elastic at the waist was a great addition that made it look classy, and the mid thigh length was perfect - plus it covered my butt when I sat down. It folded up neatly and came in its own zip lock bag. The army green color was classy and looks wonderful with any other color/s you are wearing. This jacket will be so handy too now that I am home and need to grab a light weight casual rain jacket. The price couldn’t have been better. I would highly recommend this jacket to a friend or anyone!"

      "text": "Purchased grey and blue pants in size small. I'm 5' 1\" and weigh 137 pounds currently. Love, love the pants as they are well constructed, with good material and even stitching, and as they are soft inside, warm, but not hot, feel very comfortable, and look cute. They fit me well everywhere except for the length, which just barely hits just at or a tiny bit above my ankles when I am standing barefooted. I'll probably just wear them inside the house. These pants need to be 1\" longer so that they would be a better fit even for the petite persons who would order them. I would rate these pants with 10 stars if their length was more appropriate. 12/23/22 update: Forget the 10 stars. I still like the comfort & warmth, but theses joggers \"grow\" on you. Good is that after having been worn twice they dropped a little and are now the perfect length for me. Not so good is that the joggers stretch with movements, and with no recovery to the material, become out of shape and remain loose. You'd need to be wearing a new pair if traveling or going somewhere special, as their well-fitted look morphs into a comfy but sloppy type of \"wear at home\" look. These joggers still earn my 4-star rating for home use due to their comfort & warmth. I have a 2nd pair which I am saving for Christmas day as temps will be below freezing. Hopefully they will look good for the length of the family get-together. I'd planned to purchase a 3rd pair, but instead might just wear leggings reversed (to prevent rubbing damage) under a pair of jeans for warmth when leaving the house on those exceptionally cold days."

They're definitely well-constructed, and they arrive quickly. . I've got a large hiney and am always aware of that when I buy pants - so I ordered a size 5x hoping they'd be roomy enough for casual lounging. I took them from their clear plastic packaging bags when they arrived and held one up. It seemed very large and, honestly, I thought that if *this* fit my butt, I'd better do more walking. . Trying one on I realized that it was, indeed, enormous. Almost comically so. (First time in a long while I put a pair of pants on and didn't have to wonder if they'd still be comfy in four hours.) I kept them on for a while, pulling the drawstrings tight while recognizing that the fabric - front and back - was all bunched up. I really wanted them to work. . But they did not. They were quite simply far too large to keep. Reopening Amazon I began the return process, and when asked if I wanted to replace these two, I chose 'yes' and clicked on size 3x sweatpants. Sadly, there are no size 3x sweats left. At least not in black. Oh, I could get burgundy, charcoal heather, or navy heather - but I want black. So we'll see, I guess. The takeaway: THESE ARE HUGE! Buy accordingly."

Because of the ribbing around the ankle and the tapering on the leg, possibly they were going for a boot cut? - Makes them very unflattering but I bought mine for gardening, so I’m fine with that. I will say it fit exactly to size, but I tend to like things a little sloppier when I’m just gonna wear them only at home or outside, so I might go a size up next time. Good quality well-made especially for the price, would buy them again, but not flattering for those who care. Perhaps on a taller thinner person, it would look different. But I like them!"

If you were much taller it may be an issue. That said, they are VERY soft and VERY warm! They're comfortable to wear, and the waist fits nicely and sits at a good place. The fabric seems thick and substantial. I bought these to wear at home, and they work well for that. If you're prioritizing comfort over looks, these are good pants for you :P"

The length is okay, slightly on the longer side, but the main issue with sizing is in the waist. There’s a lot of extra fabric in the front and extra space in the waist even with the drawstring pulled tight. I’m not sure if they will shrink a bit in the wash. I purchased three pair and ended up returning two. I’ll update if the pair I kept show any shrinkage after being washed and dried. Overall I recommend the product, just be mindful of the sizing."

I am 5'0\" and weight 133. They are very soft and comfortable and fit just right in the stride and sit at my waist. They are the perfect length for me and hit right at my ankle. I was really surprised at the quality and the feel of the fabric. They are not only good for walking/exercising but I will definitely be wearing these to run errands, visit friends, etc. I just hope they will last as long as the ones I've been wearing and that were worn by my son before me!

You don't need to as I say but I will as I have Cancer and feel even the slightest tightness. I am shocked at the quality and reckon they will be fabulous for winter.

I was frustrated with paying a fortune for “warm” PJ bottoms so decided I’d try these as an alternative. Winner! They are comfortable for bed, around the house, going to the gym, whatever! They are the ONLY bottoms that keep my legs warm in bed at night when no heating is on. More than a pair of leggings with PJ pants then on top! I am a size 18 in jeans/pants. I am 81kg (178 lbs) and 166cm (about 5”4). I don’t have very large thighs, bum or calves but do have a tummy on me. I got the XL and they are very loose on me around the waist even when I pull the drawstring tight. They are loose enough on my legs to be comfy but again a bit baggy on me. If you have quite large thighs and calves the XL would possibly be just right for you those areas. These are VERY roomy. But as you can try before you buy see what’s good for you. Being a bit tighter may suit you fine. They are very warm with the lovely fleece lining and did I say really comfortable? The fabric is really nice. I got the grey ones and I’ve now just paid for them after trying out (love that option Amazon!). I’ve now ordered 4 more pairs in different colours but I’ve ordered the Large not the XL this time which I think will fit me better (I’ll review those and let you know). I’ve given my two XL pairs to my son (as look unisex) and he’s got really chunky legs, bum and a tummy and they fit him great with a close fit. He loves them (he is 100kg). Being on a budget some colours are cheaper than others so check that out if saving money too! These will do me great through winter as PJ bottoms and loungewear. A double win. Very impressed and better than a lot of Pajama bottoms which are extremely overpriced just now. 100% recommend these! Work great with a fleece lined top or hoodie. Just measure yourself if possible against the sizing as everybody is shaped differently."

I've worn them and washed them extensively. Still fits the same and looks the same awesome hoodies. I correct what I said before. They are BETTER than the name brand ones I've tried! Perfect fit (at least for my body type--I'm 5'7\" and weigh 143 lbs). Material is not to thin or too thick. They are not too long so you don't look ridiculous wearing them untucked (most people don't wear their hoodies tucked into their pants).

Here is my feedback on this product: Pros: - Quick delivery - Soft fabric - I like the hoodie aspect to this shirt - Washed and dried fine without shrinking (keep in mind I hung dry it but washed in warm). - Price is great Cons: - It's really \"bunched\" in the front neck part. They over lapped some of the fabric and it's not very practical looking for a sleeveless shirt... sweater yes... sleeveless shirt, no. - It has a pretty strong chemical smell right out of the packet. - There has been several loose threads - Arm holes are smaller than I'd like for a large. - The overall fit is \"meh\" Final Thoughts: Even though I like the feel of the fabric, I feel like this shirt is going to fall apart after 5 or 6 wears. I also wouldn't wear this in public to be honest simply because the neck/collar of the shirt is folded over itself to accommodate the hood. It doesn't look good. Would I buy again? No. It's worth it to pay a bit more for a better quality sleeveless shirt. I hope you found my feedback helpful. Thanks"

The stretchy tech material is really comfortable and makes the hoodie look great. As for sizing... I'd say it's true to size. I usually wear L or 52/54 EU in sports clothing (height 185cm / chest 41.5 inches / build athetic to normal) and the hoodie fits me great (not skin-tight but not loose either). It is a bit long and it's a bit tight on the chest (not as tight as muscle fit clothes but tighter than normal fit) but for me that's a plus. Highly recommended!"

However, as soon as I stepped into these shoes I knew that I wouldn't be able to wear them. The design has been changed significantly - flyte foam has replaced the gel at the toe end, and the bottom of the shoe is flat. In itself those may not be deficiencies and perhaps there are some folks out there who prefer the new style. Not me. They were way to tight and constraining - my toe rubbed against the front of the shoe and although they were light my feet hurt just wearing them around the house. I have been running in Gel Cumulus shoes for many years - at least a decade - and I've always been able to make an easy transition from one model to the next .On the plus side - they are extremely attractive shoes - and they appear to be solidly made. But I ended up returning them, now looking for a different neutral shoe."

Comfortable for running in, and have helped with hip, ankle and knee pain from the wrong alignment. It will depend on the shape of your foot, but if you have taller arches, these are definitely worth considering. I usually wear a 7.5 without socks/8 with socks. The 7.5 in these are a perfect fit for me WITH sock on, so they run slightly bigger than expected."

The heel is nicely supported and locked into place, but soft enough to feel comfortable. I run on roads regularly and am looking forward to having more cushioning with these as opposed to the ASICS I had before. I tried the nimbus 21 simultaneously, and the cumulus was my winner.

So depending on your vision, near or far sighted, they may not work for you. I am far sighted, I can wear readers all the time but have to have them for reading and close up work ( or rx glasses ) I love that I didn’t have to pay over $200 for a pair of rx multi focal sunglasses! These do everything my rx glasses would have done for me in regards to outdoors. I did try a pair of this brand bifocals and returned them. Nothing wrong except I couldn’t handle the bifocal line…my multi focal rx glasses have me spoiled in that manner. I hope this helps someone who is deciding what will work for them."

I read some reviews saying “the zipper gets stuck”, “it wasn’t the real Jansport”, “it’s missing this & that”, etc. But I have had my jansport (Left/Pink) for 6 years now & it never disappointed! I bought a new one because the strap on my old one got brittle & broke. Trust me when I say, I’ve made good use of it over the years with traveling & everything in between. The tags, zippers, everything seems legit. So if you’re looking into a long lasting bag, this is one of them!"

Can't complain though, I truly wear my slippers every day. Even scoot outside in them. EDIT (Aug 25 2020) - Slippers are in the garbage. Outsole started to split away at the heel a while ago. Last week the insole started to creep out, and yesterday it fell out entirely. I wear my slippers every day, so I'm not surprised... but they last about as long as cheaper ones I've purchased. Now I know it doesn't matter if I spend an extra $20; it won't make them last any longer. EDIT (Apr 3 2020) - They don't mark up the floor anymore and haven't for a while. Seemed to be just surface rubber transfer. Just got these today... they're really cute and seem like they are very comfortable. I ordered a Medium, which I anticipated would be a size 7-8 and was correct. I like that they have a rubber sole; only problem so far is that they are marking up the floors a bit. Not a dealbreaker for me... wipes off easily."

After a month, the cushioning had started to flatten down and the slippers had stretched enough that my feet were sliding around and a couple of times my ankle actually rolled. I tried putting in insoles and it helped for a bit but by the three-month mark the insoles weren’t enough, and the seams had started to separate from the side and back of the soles. I would also dispute the company’s claim of these having a durable sole, as the tread on the heel has started to wear away. I have never worn these outside, they were inside slippers only. I would have expected them to stay comfortable and last longer than three months for $28 so based on my experience, I can’t recommend buying these slippers."

      "text": "I have bought this anklet from this vendor multiple times over the years! It’s absolutely gorgeous and lasts a long time, and if you take proper care of it, it’ll last evennnn longer. Since it’s not a solid gold piece, any consistent water exposure will eventually result in to tarnish a bit (as is the case with ANY gold-plated and gold-filled jewelry), so I recommend limiting it from getting wet for extended periods as much as possible and immediately dabbing it dry w/ a towel or cloth when you do! I still wear these anklets nearly 24/7 though, and not only do they look super classy but they still hold up better than any other anklet I’ve found on Amazon in this price range… even with a good amount of water exposure (bc tbh I’m sometimes just too lazy to take it off before a shower lol) Only recently did I run into an issue with a product when the clasp on the last anklet I’d ordered randomly broke off while I was wearing it! I know this is unusual because nothing like this has ever happened in my experiences buying from this vendor, and realize this was probably just a fluke. Regardless, I figured I’d still reach out to the seller anyways and explain the situation, and they kindly sent me a replacement totally free of charge! It was super sweet of them and only further adds to my list of reasons for continuing to be a loyal customer! :)"

      "text": "Dear lord have mercy these are not for short folk. I thought surely my ribs would crack or I'd pass out from oxygen deprivation. Now before you say I must have purchased the wrong size, I purchased one of these in my size, another one size up because I don't trust anything I can't try on and my success at online shopping has been very hit or miss. The result was the same in either pair, so this is not about sizing. The first thing to know I am 5'4 and purchased these for a little shaping in the hips and stomach. I did not know I was also purchasing a torture device! As I rolled that first pair up over my thighs I thought, hmm firm, and up over the belly, really firm. I kept rolling, and rolling, and rolling. Where do these things end! Now I'm getting real close to some delicates that sit well enough above my stomach that they should not be impacted, special things I don't want flattened out. Wrong! So now I have two options I can cover my upper delicates and flatten those out too, hello 5'4 extra thick board! Or I can stop unrolling these things, fold them down a bit, because an extra bulky ridge anywhere is exactly what I was looking for......I chose to fold them down a bit because flat wide board wasn't the look I was going for. Let me tell you, I chose wrong. The fabric these are made from is strong and the waistband on these are very, very strong. Now that's three very strongs right there all rolled into one, directly under my ta-ta's, coiled around my body like a starved boa constrictor that just wanted me to die! Added to that, there's still all that really strong fabric I assume was intended to cover the stomach of a giantess crushing my ribcage.....I...could...not...breathe....world...spinning....lights dimming.....HEEEELP! Now before you say you should never fold them down; you are right and I know this. But these things are never ending. It's not trying to squeeze yourself into a pair of hosiery that's just too small, where you pull and stretch and suck it in the make them stretch up to your waist. Nooo, no no no, these things are not those things, these things are just designed for someone at least 7 ft tall with a stomach waist area the length of my entire upper body. Trust me I considered user error, rolled them off and back on again and just stopped that waistband right at my waist which was about as effective as well I don't even know because it was not effective at all, but it was bulky. Moving along to the next pair, I have no idea what I was thinking, because this pair was no better. I did everything in my power to not pull or stretch them in any way. Just thrust one chubby thigh in after the other and then pretended I was a weeble wobble. A little shake and shimmy, A wiggle, a weeble and a wobble and I'm in! I gently eased that fabric covered super strength boa constrictor waist into place just above my natural waist and definitely below my ladies on high. Now I'm still breathing but they felt very heavy in the stomach area, almost as if there was just too much fabric piled on my stomach and I could have pulled them much, much further up. I also immediately noticed my stomach was definitely being \"shaped\". It was a very weird feeling. I felt like I was sucking in my stomach but also had a pile of concrete blocks pushing my stomach further in well past any average \"sucking in\" . Suddenly I was standing very straight, like a soldier at attention. I could not relax my stance, I tried. As the web of murder continued to exert all the forces of the universe on my stomach, all the body mass had to go somewhere, and it went up! I am fairly certain one of my kidneys just popped right on up under my ribs. What was that pain pressing against my spine? Well, that was the rest of my internal organs all pressing back and up, against my spinal column and under my ribs. All this pressure and upward movement of body mass and organs was making it difficult to breathe; short breaths, short breaths......I couldn't stand at attention any longer, so as my organs continued to shift, I slowly sat down. Have you ever tried to sit while part of your body is wrapped in a body cast? Me neither until right then. Now I am sitting there, straight as a board, my stomach continuing to cave in, my refugee organs pressing further and further into the space previously occupied by my lungs making breathing more difficult by the second. This was not working out, I had to get out of this torture device, I needed to breathe! Seriously, I needed oxygen....to live. And so, with every intention of rolling the death shapers off my body, I stood up and that is all I remember. I woke up on the floor with my husband kneeling over me, scissors in hand, a fresh red welt clearly visible. Apparently, he was unable to work his stubby fingers under the boa constrictor waistband and did the next best thing; he cut that medieval death shaper from the thigh up. When the scissors finally chewed through the waistband, that angry snake band decided it was not going down without a fight, snapped back and gave the poor man a welt. Ladies, if you’re tall, into BDMS or torture, you might like these. If you want to test your pain tolerance or endurance, these are for you. If like me, you prefer the security of knowing all your internal organs are in their designated spaces, move along to the next product. If you are short, move along. Lastly if breathing is not relevant to you have at these, for the rest of you, if you like breathing as much as I do, just keep scrolling, these are not for you or me."

They have the jelly-type line to help it not roll down that I think would eventually be uncomfortable. The fabric was comfortable but it felt sticky like my dress kept sticking to it as I tried to pull it on. It did smooth everything though I would like more smoothing on my lower stomach.

      "text": "Great shaper shorts, with a couple of caveats. The sizing runs much smaller than most clothing brands so take measurements. I went up 2 sizes from my normal to keep from feeling painfully squeezed in these. It may have something to do with my very pear shaped body: small waist and large hips/bottom. Also, despite the silicone grippers im the waistband, these do still roll down on me a bit. I kind of wish I could tuck the upper edge under my bra. Otherwise they function as intended and are made of good materials."

They are soft and warm, look good, and fit well. No issues with the button holes this time. Previous review (for first order); The pajamas arrived on time. They are attractive, soft, and warm, but they had one flaw. The button holes were all too large, so the pajama top would not stay buttoned. We partly closing the holes with needle and thread. That fixed the problem, so we did not send the PJs back, but it was disappointing. That was likely a manufacturing defect, as the PJs were new in their package, with labels intact."

      "text": "While I was impressed at the cost for such an item, this item did come in VERY VERY snug. I am 5'9 (175.3cm) at 190lb so I opted for the XL size as it seemed to be the best option but was VERY snug in the *package* area and sitting was very difficult as it tend to ride up in places. Fast Forward several months later, I wrote a review that I was disappointed and the seller reached out to me to see if there was anything they could do. They did offer to send me a replacement in the XXL size. While this isn't a size I was Ever used to ordering, they did mention that it was definitely larger, that it would fit much better but that it had a button vs zipper style that the original one came it. I would have preferred the zipper but the difference really was negligible and really not noticeable. Convenience definitely lends itself to a zipper front but I am more impressed that the seller was willing to be so helpful months after the purchase and make it right. Kudos to Amazon Seller - SOGSILK, you did an outstanding job. 4 stars. (-1 because the supplier couldn't provide you a larger style with a zipper but that's not for a lack of effort on your part.)"

The fit isn’t the same as the my one year old much more worn pair of Roshe Ones.

I'd vote 4.5 if I could, only because I find the material is a bit too lightweight for me (you could practically fold then shoe down like a piece of fabric if you wanted). This could be useful for some, - say you were going on holiday and packing light, wanted to keep a pair of shoes in a small bag etc. Also bear in mind they get dirty very easy and if it rains your feet get literally soaked they offer no protection from water (I got caught in the downpours last month). Saying that they're a great summer-wear, nice and airy."

These are a little pricey IMO, but they are the best I have found so far. The old style flexees were the best overall, and I still have a few pairs. They held up too well, I guess, so the next gen flexees blew out in about six months or so. These Spanx control briefs are a medium control, and that's OK. However, if I was going to use a control brief for a slinky sort of dress, I would need more tummy control."

      "text": "I bought a L henley in the olive color and am very happy with it. I've bought a number of henley shirts in various brands over the years, and this is definitely one of the best. The material is soft and comfortable, the fabric a light to medium weight, and the fit is nice though a bit smaller than ideal for me, and the neck/collar area is very comfortable. I'm just under 5'10' and 150+ lbs, with proportionally longer arms. The body on this is less roomy than I like, and the arms are also fairly close fitting, but I really prefer more loose fitting henleys rather than snug to the body. The sleeve length after washing is great for my arms, and I find that with I like this loose cuff more than the tight elastic cuff that's more common on henleys. The shirt length is a few inches below my waist, not excessively long. I like the soft olive shade of the one I bought. I almost scored this one with five stars, but the couple of minor issues I mentioned are all that left me at the four star rating. Overall, I'm impressed with this shirt, and the price is excellent."

But as soon as you get tall sizes, prices double or triple. Henleys, designs, material, fit, all add to the price. But after wearing what are essentially undershirts, I broke down and bought this $20 shirt. The sleeves are nice and long. The fabric is soft and comfortable. The colors are not plain. Even the buttons match the color of the shirt. It’s worth it to find clothing that fits and looks good. Kind of a shame that Amazon, or anyone, chooses to charge a premium for something that costs no more to make than regular sizes."

Unfortunately these Amazon shirts fall short, literally, of my expectations. The shirt is not long enough to stay tucked in. At 5'7\", I usually don't need to buy the tall versions of a shirt. In this case, I would need the tall version to keep my shirt tucked in and my belly covered. My other gripe is the cheap cuff, they just folded the material over and sewed the cuff instead of making a separate cuff like the Hanes Henley shirts that I bought. I will go back to buying the Hanes shirts and, when I can justify the cost, the Carharts."

Instead this one has a cut from the armpit to neck giving you the roundish shoulder. If you are not used to this style, you might feel weird.

Also, parts of it uncurl and seem impossible to stay in place. The top of the leggings where they attach are tight due to the elasticity so unless you have 0% fat on your legs, you'll get muffin top thighs - this was the disappointing part. BUT EASY FIX. I purchased jean shorts to go over it Other reviews said leggings didn't fit right but they were perfect for me. Overall, I'd buy again for the price."

Had to put spandex on under the romper so you couldn't see my cheeks (I have an above average size bottom) or my thong through the fabric. The neck was a little tight as well, but I mean, I could still breath. Super cute costume!"

Hand-finished with a heart-shaped clasp, this snake chain bracelet looks stunning on its own but even better adorned with your favorite Pandora charms and clips. Layer it with contrasting Pandora chain bracelets for a chic, multi-layered look.Product Description To find your perfect bracelet size, wrap a soft tape measure around your wrist (tightly but not so it feels uncomfortable), then add 2 cm to the measurement.

Frye opened the doors to his very first store, paving the way for countless generations of Frye artisans dedicated entirely to the art of craftsmanship. The result is beautifully made footwear, bags and accessories with a long and illustrious history. Today that legacy continues with the introduction this fall of Frye’s first-ever apparel collection for men and women. Rooted in tradition, Frye was originally inspired by our everyday American heroes over the decades. Cavalry infantrymen. World War II soldiers. Fighter pilots. Factory workers. Frye traveled the world on the feet of our servicemen — even General Patton. News of Frye’s outstanding quality and reputation spread. Frye has since become an American icon, outfitting many of the world’s biggest names from John Lennon to Jackie O. Chosen for its inimitable style and uncompromising quality, Frye is a longtime favorite of rock stars and celebrities alike. Frye’s iconic boots have defined eras, embodied social movements, outlasted trends and defied time. Frye captures the essence of timeless American style – the promise of a dream. That promise is held deep within the DNA of our very own genetic codes. Embedded within our legendary and historic styles remains a wellspring of the promise of adventure, courage and individual freedom. Against the backdrop of the great American landscape, Frye’s place in history is assured. There are many lookalikes but only one Frye. The Original. The Authentic. The Only. Read more ",

      "text": "Great stylish alternative to suede UGG's with adjustable bottom buckle, easy to clean too, the bottom soles are made with thick quality rubber which provides good arch support and traction without adding extra weight. Keep legs / feet warm during freezing nyc weather and comfortable wear right out the box. However, would not recommend wearing if it's raining heavily or stepping into slush puddles :) Rating this boot - 3 1/2 star for the reasons listed... Now for a $600+ pair of boots one would expect quality and great fit. Which is not the case fit wise, the leather is supple (not rigid stiff like other frye boots) and fur inside is thick which is great. But the fit (upper part is a bit wide), length (NOT over the knee, needs one inch more) and zipper (half zipper) all 3 parts need to be redesign. As someone who is 5'6 with a slim calf, the top part is wide...kinda like a floppy pirate boots and only reaches middle of knee making it look clunky, Half zippers are annoying since it makes the boot to bunch up slightly midway and taking them off requires a bit of effort. Why not make the boot with full zipper so it's easy to slip on and off and to eliminate the bunching? Also maybe add a adjustable buckle to the top so the width can be adjusted. Packaging could be better, boot arrived stuff with tissue paper in a no frills Frye box and no cloth bags included. Although I don't own any designer shoes except this one... noticed other shoes that are several $$$ have cloth bags... In any event hope Frye will make these improvements to the Valerie OTK boots. Would I purchase these boots at full price? Absolutely Not. When Amazon had a nice sale decided to get em to wear in cold weather."

      "text": "Another pair of Frye boots to love! These are winter boots so they are not for everyday wear. Lined with angora wool so they are warm all the way up over-the-knee. Too warm for indoor use (fine outdoors, but likely a bit hot for an indoor mall). They are somewhat tighter through the calf than the other OTK boots due to the wool lining. The soles are good grippers for winter weather (although so far I have only had one occasion to wear them in the snow and ice). They are comfortable as the soles seem to have a cushioning layer both for insulation and walking comfort. These will finally replace my old pair ( Blondo OTK ) that have served for some 30 years. One minor caution is that metal zipper extends all the way down to the sole for easy entry and exit. But, as those of us that live in snowy country know, a zipper going to the bottom will collect wet snow and ice and freeze in real winter weather or sometimes leak in snow-puddles. So be careful where you step. Still, really fine boots that you will love for the snowy weather."

These boots are real shearling all the up, my calves fit perfectly (I have normal to bit defined calves & is not an issue--thats the soft shearling distressed leather portion of boot), true to fit (no breaking in), gripping soles that work w/o construction boot look, soft distressed leather (texture in black gives a hint of matte finish compared to its taut leathered perfectly shaped toe, seams & zippers are well placed, inner boot placed antiqued zippers are smooth-quality-good length! Shearling is soft & on the black boot appears more grayish (natural appearance, no spots) than \"brownish\". Love the fur & leather blending (for versatility) vs Contrasting colors: brown or winter white fur on black leather) & antigued/adjustable (3 holes) Frye side ankle buckle is proportional to the boot. The boots have a comfortable yet supportive feel, too. Arrived ahead of time in a well packed Frye box! These are my gorgeous classic, functional go to winter boots!"

Unfortunately size 6.5 does not fit my 14\" calves with pants on. Even without pants, it does not pull up easily, and bunches at the ankle. I don't think my calves are too big and rarely have fitting problem like this when it comes to boots."

      "text": "In my opinion, these are not up to Frye quality and look. They do not look as nice and modern and unique as other Frye boots. Leather looks more like PU leather. Lining is thin comparing to Uggs (that I personally ware on bare feet in coldest days). This one I would need to ware with socks. They are also very tight at arch area even if you go 1/2 size or even size bigger. I got them in 7.5 (my regular Frye size), and I did not feel comfortable. My friend ordered in 6.5 and also had the same issue. She tried mine 7.5, and while she found that length of boots feet area was longer, it still was uncomfortable in arch area. But if you have narrow feet then you may fill comfortable. Conclusion is that even if we put that narrow arch part aside, it doesn't worth even discount price, in my opinion. Therefore three stars only. Sorry Frye, love you, but you could've done better with this one."

Even at $300 these are pricey...but I can't wait for the cold weather so I can wear these boots! The leather is very soft and the shearling is thick and cozy. They fit well, but I do feel that the foot is a bit on the small side. Perhaps this is from the shearling. I'm hoping and assuming they will stretch out a bit with wear."

They are very heavy and sulk down at the ankle area, where the wrinkle causes the zipper to rub into the skin. I was beyond thrilled to have them except for this one issue that would be solved by wearing socks. Unfortunately I buy shearling boots to roam sock-free so this is a deal breaker for me! For those who don’t mind wearing socks in shearling boots they are stunning."

The winder I purchased did not keep the Rolex sufficiently wound, so in effect, it was useless. I did some research, and found this winder to be recommended by Rolex, so I sent my wife the link. The winder looks very nice, and works perfectly. It spins the watch once every eight or twelve minutes (for my watch, I use the default eight minute setting), and once it spins the around a single roatate, the watch will gyrate back and fortch, mimicing the motion a watch will actually get while being worn. The motor is silent, making no audible noise I can hear whatsoever. Also, the case keeps the watch itself covered, which I prefer. I don't care for open faced watch winders. I like my watch inside a protective case. The cushion you mount the watch on is easy to use, and will not damage the watch. Excellent product that does it's intended job perfectly."

      "text": "First off Amazon asked if it provides good arch support. I answered no. Read the end of my review for an explanation of that. This review is based off finding a fit and buying two pairs of CNX Clearwater in two different sizes for two individuals: Pair 1: I am a male with a narrow fitting heel and an average or narrower forefoot (toes). My bone structure is slight and I am very thin and I have no “meat” on my feet or ankles (or anywhere for that matter). I have a difficult time finding clothes that fit my frame and finding shoes that are long enough for my foot without being loose and sloppy in the width especially the heel. I owned a pair of Keen Men’s Newport (original from the first model year not H2) size 10.5 and found them to be rugged for working outdoor and great for slip on ease and airport travel. When the Keen Company was just getting off the ground they focused on ruggedness and roominess. The Newports were just too heavy, roomy in the width and clunky for my slight foot and I could not stand to wear them for any great length of time. Also I had to cinch the heck out of the bungee fastener to get the shoe to stay on and not slip off my heel when I walked. The original Newport ran small in length and I had to go up one size or half size to get the proper length. Then years later Keen introduced the CNX line, a lightweight and fitted (narrower) series of shoe. I originally got the Men’s 10 CNX Clearwater and found them to have too much material over the top of my foot. This was because the shoes was just too roomy for my skinny foot. I had to cinch the heck out of the bungee fastener to make the shoes stay on and not slip off my heel when I walked. This had the effect of folding over excess fabric in the mono-sock collar design of the shoe and would dig into the top of my foot uncomfortably. I tried the Men’s CNX Clearwater size 9.5 and found they were just not long enough for my foot and my toe just slightly hit the toe cap of the shoe in an uncomfortable way. The 9.5 however was a much better fit in the ankle and did not have as much excess material around the mono-sock collar when the bungee was cinched. I found the Clearwater to be about true to size where the Newport ran small. In recent years I have found that women’s shoes are often narrower than men’s. They usually are more colorful too and that isn’t bad for someone like myself that likes colors other than black, red, brown and white. I tried the Women’s Clearwater size 11 and found the fit was spot on. I still have to cinch the heck out of the bungee but the fold over of the mono-sock collar is minimal and is not enough to dig into my foot. The width of the Women’s size 11 is still roomy but not excessively so. So far I have had great luck wearing this shoe all day with no issues. Pair 2: My wife was a huge Keen Whisper fan. She had previously tried the Keen Newport H2 and Venice and found them to be too roomy and slipped off the back of her heel. Her Keen Whisper size is 8. She does not like to or have time to shop and found the Whisper fit to be good enough and stuck with that. With my revelation that the Keen CNX Clearwater fit almost true to size I ordered her a 7.5, her usual dress flat size. It was in her favorite color and I knew she would give it a try because of that. It fits her perfectly, and she finds it very lightweight and comfortable and better fitting around the foot compared to the Keen Whisper. Her only point to note is that she likes the Whisper bungee cinch system better than the mono-sock collar of the Clearwater. She finds that to cinch the Clearwater tight enough to where there is no heel slip the material folds over and if not positioned just right, can dig into the top of her foot. Conclusion: In short this Keen Women’s CNX Clearwater fits us both better than any Keen shoe we have yet tried. Keen has made an attempt to welcome those with narrow or medium width feet into the Keen wearing flock. We would both say that the width fit for us is the as our regular athletic shoes fit. For length she fits into her regular dress shoe size with in this shoe. Of the Women’s shoes I do own this fits like some 11’s do and like some 12’s do (I do not own any 11.5). To compare the fit more universally, for me the Clearwater 11 fits like Men’s 9-9.5, Women’s 11-11.5 Converse Chuck Taylor and for her the Clearwater 7.5 fits like Men’s size 5 Women’s 7 Converse Chuck Taylor. Arch Support: Everyone thinks of arch support differently so I really don’t like the question. I have noticed most people confuse arch support with stability and motion control. Look up “pronation shoes” on google for more information. Most people that want arch support really mean they want “motion control” or “stability” shoes. These shoes force the feet to roll outward when running, walking and standing. The majority of people have feet the roll inward naturally and feel only the insides of their feet are bearing the weight and pressure. This has nothing to do with arch support. I have been told by two doctors I have a high arch on my foot. I am a light runner and use minimalist or barefoot shoes for running. I suppose I have somewhat strong feet. I was told arch support comes from within the foot and is provided by muscles and tendons of the foot. I was told flat feet can be hereditary or come as a result of wearing stiff inflexible shoes over a period of time that cause atrophy of the muscles. I was told no amount of upward arch curve in a shoe will correct flat feet. Exercise and flexible shoes, barefoot shoes or actually being barefoot while doing exercise to strengthen foot muscles may help return an arch to the natural shape or keep an arch strong. The arch curve of this Clearwater shoe does not even come close to contacting the bottom of my foot in the arch area. In fact only once every few years will I ever find a shoe that the built in arch “support” bump actually contacts the arch of my foot. When I do find that, it creates a great amount of artificial pressure on my tendon and is painful and torturous to walk or stand in. Again everyone is different."

      "text": "I take an 8-8.5. The JBU shoe I just bought in an 8 fit perfectly--even a bit loose. 8.5 in NB and Brooks running shoes. I'm not sure if this review will reflect that I purchased the 8 or the 8.5, but I ordered both at the same time. Both are extremely small. Both are well made and I can tell the footbed is lovely. The inside is smooth. But, if I were going to reorder, I don't think the 9 would be big enough. I think perhaps I'd order the 9.5. So, I'd say a solid 1.5 sizes (counting by 1/2 sizes) too small for my foot--just to fit. I have wide toes and narrow heels. If you have really narrow feet, perhaps a full size larger than your size would be enough? I'm not going to reorder. Although these look cute in the box and I'd would have liked to try on the correct size, they are ugly. I mean--really ugly--or, I should say, unflattering. I don't mind ugly. There has to be a better option in terms of appearance. My wide foot looked like a flat square box in these, despite the fact that they were squishing them. These made me look like Fred Flintstone, and I don't have ugly feet. So, there you go."

Combing reviews of Keen shoes, I learned that this model fits narrow feet best, and that is true. But did not expect this fantastic toe box! I have what I call \"curly toe\" - my big toes curl up like an elf - and have real trouble with shoes. Most are simply not made to fit toes like this. I wear holes in canvas, and just can't wear most shoes. They cause great pain. This is the first time I've had a toe box that is actually high enough that I can WIGGLE my toes! These shoes are so comfortable I don't take them off in the evenings; I wear them until bedtime. I love the gummy soles; they give me bouncy energy. I love the adjustability of the bunjee cord. I was afraid I would find them uncomfortable around my ankle and difficult to put on and off because there is no velcro opening/closure around the ankle. But contraire! They are actually EASIER to put on/take off than all my other shoes! I love the blue/pattern color too. In short, these are likely the best shoes I've ever had. I hope this model shoe is not discontinued. If you have narrow feet and/or curled up toes, this shoe is for you."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United Kingdom on July 7, 2019",
      "text": "If you only buy one pair of walking sandals in your life, buy these! The fit is exact and all encompassing - like wearing a supportive sock with a firm, cushioned sole! The heel strap, unlike some walking sandals, fits snugly round the heel in exactly the right place without slipping or chafing and there's even a small catch for the excess elastic after you've tightened it. Toes are well protected by a rubber bumper but without the toe-stubbing that one sometimes gets from these type of shoes. Perfect! This particular pair are blue with a pattern but I also have a the grey and the fuchsia-pink version. The blue look particularly good with rolled up jeans or shorts and I tend to wear them at home rather than for walking holidays so they'll only get field and pavement walking whereas the other pairs get some real hammer when I go on walking holidays. They stay in place in the roughest of terrain and if you're hot, you can stand in the nearest stream to cool your feet without any harm to the shoes. If you wear them in the sea you will get salt-stains when they dry so I'd recommend rinsing them in cold water afterwards. The manufacturer says you can actually put them in the washing machine but I've never tried this - I tend to just fill the sink with some tepid water and hand-washing liquid and give them a gentle wash. To get right down to the bottom of the foot-bed, I use an old toothbrush. It gets right into the toe and keeps your shoes feeling and smelling fresh. Put them in a warm, sunny place, preferably with the heels downwards to let the water drain out and they'll be dry in a couple of hours. I've had my grey ones for three years now and worn them up hill and down dale with hardly any signs of wear so if you are dithering over whether or not to buy some (they are quite expensive) I'd definitely say 'go for it' - you won't regret it - it's money well spent!"

I love the light blue canvas colour and the fact that these shoes have built in arches to support my feet, especially with the huge amount of walking mileage that I do. Beware: little stones, dust and dirt can enter! The soles are rubberised and have grip. My first foray with these was a 6 km hike through woodland and farmland. I wore them on a humid day with no socks. These sandals were brilliant and I am pleased to report that I experienced no friction and no blisters. I have had to order a whole size larger as not only do feet swell in the summer, but these do come up quite narrow. I also have small bunions and these are successfully concealed and accommodated with no problems."

As far as quality, seems decently made for a costume. Stitching is tight, fabric is thin costume type material, so not sure how that will hold up...but it's cute. One issue I found with it was on the seam of the skirt there was a long piece of fabric that was sticking out l just cut it off and it's fine. I think for the price of $17.99 it is pretty cute and will be loved by the little girl who is getting this for Christmas. Details of costume: dress has stretchy velvet material at the top with glitter stamp design, satin type arms and skirt is satin type material with a organza type overlay on front with glitter design stamped on. The skirt on the dress also has a \"slip type thing\" sewn in on the inside. All of the gold piping on the dress is sewn on and the top part of the dress has a removable Anna pin (the pin is kind of generic looking - like a knock off copy). The back of the dress closes with several small squares of velcro on the top part of the dress. Cape looks just like picture, has velcro closure and a small jewel sewn on. Cape is also thin satin type material trimmes in gold piping that is sewn."

I only had two issues with the costume. First, the fabric is thin and delicate, so I didn't let my daughter wear it to play around the house in until after our event, because I was worried that it would tear very easily. Second, I steamed it beforehand so it would look nice, and it only took about 30 seconds after putting it on to have it entirely wrinkly again. These issues really didn't bother me because I got the costume for a low price. Overall, I'm really happy with this costume."

I had my daughter try it on (she just turned 4) and is at the 50% range for height and weight for her age. The size 4-5 appeared to fit perfectly except for length which was a little long. I'm hoping since the top is stretchy it will fit longer than it looks like it will. Knowing the fit of the costume I would probably have ordered a size up and just planned to hem it. Overall the quality and look of the costume appears good except for the anna pin on the front. The photo is distorted so I just took the pin off and it looks better without it anyway."

My daughter is 4 and the dress fits her everywhere else except for the skirt is long, especially in the front. We will be having it slightly hemmed soon so that she doesn't trip on it. Problem is that if we would have went for a smaller size, the bodice would have been way too tight, as it nearly is now.

      "text": "I'm writing this review to help others get the tarnish off of heavily tarnished items. I had an eagle charm that was beautiful but stopped wearing it because I rotate my jewelry and I didn't keep it in a safe place. I tried another very popular solution, but it still didn't clean the charm to my satisfaction. I even used a toothbrush with the old solution but it still wasn't clean enough. I then used a jeweler's cloth to help to no avail. I had used this product before, but the solution leaked a lot because I didn't close it all of the way so I trashed it. I decided to give this one a try again, and it worked! A rinse with soap and water got rid of the smell. I wear gloves when cleaning my jewelry because the oils on your fingers could cause your piece to tarnish first. This solution will cause slight chemical burns, so I wear gloves for that reason. When you clean silver, the solution strips away a minute amount of silver so keep your silver pieces in a small bag to keep from air getting to it and causing it to tarnish again. Polishing silver can wear away a layer of silver, so using the instructions saying to use it UP TO 10 swishes to remove the tarnish is a must and I check the piece after three dunks, then another three to see if it worked. Use it too much, and it will ruin your jewelry. I found that my jewelry, even with the rinse, comes out a bit dull, but I use the buffing side of a jewelers cloth to not only shine the piece but to put a protective coating to keep it from tarnishing so quickly. You can use jewelry polish if you so desire. I read that wearing your jewelry can keep it from tarnishing so I wear the pieces or store them in jewelry bags to keep the oxidation off and creating more tarnish. I have one bracelet that has lasted 20 years that hasn't needed tarnishing in all of that time, so that may be the reason it didn't tarnish. I wear that piece 24/7. This solution did what other products didn't do as well. If the smell is too much to handle, I recommend using it in a well-ventilated area such as the porch or deck and the smell won't penetrate your home. These are corrosive chemicals, folks and should be treated with care. BTW, the solution smells the same as it did before, and the basket never came with a brush in either container. My guess is they make three other products where the basket does have a brush, so instead of creating a basket for just the silver solution without a brush is a way to save money. I hope this helps."

      "text": "Recently on a trip to Poland I purchased and old WW2 silver ring. The ring is in ok condition but the silver on it was dirty and mostly blackish. I wanted to try and get it clean. The first thing that I have tried is baking soda with aluminium foil and boiling water, that worked a little bit but not much. So I decided to order this fluid and give it a try. I was very sceptical at first because the ring has a little bit of red colour made of something that I do not know, I was worried the ring might get ruined but decided to risk it and try anyways. ?I submerged the ring for 10 seconds and then rinsed it under warm water with dish washing liquid, to my surprise, the ring came out looking silver again and without the black marks on it, the red part did not get ruined neither so I was very relieved. Very happy that I took the risk and that the ring looks clean now."

I decided it was time to clean and retrieved my old silver cleaner from the back of the cupboard only to realise it was no longer usable. I looked at the reviews for this one and the price was good so ordered. Remember it is only 10 seconds that you dip for, less fot items not too tarnished and voilà sparkling silver is achieved. I then dropped the items into a sink of warm slightly soapy water to wash off the chemical and then a quick buff with a towel. The picture of the earrings and Pandora necklace are the best examples as these were totally black before cleaning. It says 12 months lifespan but I had my last cleaner for years, reckon it will last a lot longer than that. Oh and wear some latex gloves as this stuff is strong. Only pain was removing the internal safety lid, I had to use scissors to remove it but I understand why it has to be so secure, you can't have a chemical like this leaking out in transit."

A quick dip, rinse, then polish with a silver polish cloth is all that’s needed to return silver jewellery to its original colour and shine. My only problem was opening the seal on the jar. These is no tab with which to peel it back. I struggled on because I didn’t have a knife or scissors at hand. I tried to push the seal inwards with my thumbs. It burst the seal open but the force that I needed to use, resulted in me jolting the jar and spilling the contents over the work surface. I lost 1/3 of the contents, as a result. I would advise puncturing the seal with a sharp knife or scissor point, then cutting it open before peeling it off."

I was going to make something from MDF or plywood, but then realized--why buy storage cubes to go inside a structure when I can just get these? They are pretty sturdy and I don't anticipate them falling apart with our light use. Fit a surprising amount. Will buy more if I can manage to stack them on top of one another without sacrificing too much space in our tiny house."

My almost 2 year old is more than capable on figuring out how to open the flaps for his toys. Its sleek, and can be used for many applications. When I first set it up in his room he decided to climb on top of it, now I dont recommend this but the storage container held his 30 lbs body along with him trying to jump on it. As long as you're not over filling the bins, if used for toys, this is a perfect storage container for a toddler room. If it lasts until hes older it will ne a great storage container for his closet, if I dont steal it for my own storage. ;p"

  "description": "From the manufacturer Read more Q Timex Our Q Timex Reissue series brings back some of our most iconic designs from the 1970s, a time when the quartz crisis was turning the mechanical watch industry upside down. Rotating Bezel When you align the center mark of your rotating bezel with the current position of the minute hand, you can then read elapsed time on the bezel. Domed Crystal Found in many vintage watches, domed acrylic crystals are shatter resistant making them preferred for dive watches. You’ll see slight dial distortion at extreme angles, an organic curve as the crystal arcs above the case, and a warmth not seen with glass. Old-School Battery Hatch The caseback hatch is a design relic from the 1970s, when watch batteries only lasted months. Some modern batteries last nearly ten years, but we remained true to our archival designs. And you may thank us after a decade of use. Read more Diver-Inspired Design With bold luminescent hands, oversized markers, and an elapsed-time bezel, we kept the integrity of the diver style without the expense of a deep sea helium relief valve. Woven Stainless Steel Bracelet Hundreds of woven stainless steel links give you a durable polished look with a flexible fit. Tested Under Pressure In the 1960s we tested the durability of our watches on boat motors, the wrist of cliff divers and even in dishwashers. And we did it all on live television. Today, nearly every Timex watch is tested for water resistance and accuracy for 24 hours before it leaves our hands. Read more ",

      "text": "We have a houseful of boy’s, & 1 Dad that are all hard workers, and hard players. Socks, & shoes/boots are always the first victims of such activities. Needless to say we go through a lot of socks. I really like the Dickie’s, and then the Merino Wool socks in winter, but they can get pricey considering everyone inconveniently (for my budget) has 2 feet. So Fruit of The Loom is one place I save money, and can usually find someone who has them on sale for less than two dollars a pair. The other socks do last longer, but not long enough to validate the cost. I do still get everyone at least 1 pair of the wool socks (the ones who don’t like the feel wear them over regular socks) for winter just because they are real outdoors types who go nuts if they spend an entire day indoors. I like to pick up a few packs every time I find them at that price point, and so far it has kept everyone in socks. When I pitch in a new pack of socks I throw out, or make rags out of as many pairs that have seen better days. If all their socks still look pretty good I just toss them in my closet until needed, because honestly no matter what brand of socks you wear - if you like playing outside, or spend a good part of your day in shoes & on your feet - you will need, or enjoy a new pack of socks at least once a year. I check socks at different times of year because I don’t want my guys going to somebody’s house, take their shoes off, and have dingy, worn out socks. I check around birthdays, start of school, & Christmas. Everyone has about 4, maybe 5(the husband has 5) packs worth of socks, and at least 1 pack’s worth will be exchanged out during the year. I have found it to be a simple way to manage all the socks. About every other year - depending on who it is they will be down about a packs worth of socks ( I still have no idea where they go), so they end up with 2 packs that year, and then you have growing feet... All kinds of good reasons to keep an eye out for deals on socks. Lol! I figure I can let it drive me mad, or manage it routinely, and keep a stash if I can. Maybe you, and your family rarely wear out, or lose socks, & spending more is the way to go, but I honestly have not seen any difference between these, and other brands a couple weeks in (some are initially fluffier, but it doesn’t last). I prefer to spend good money on the footwear over the socks. That is one place we don’t skimp is on the shoes, boots etc. that is where you really want to buy the best. Anywho as socks go we DO recommend this brand, & Hope our review is helpful to you!"

      "text": "Just got this today, and I have to say it's one of the better quality halloween costumes I've ever purchased. The flight suit is almost identical to the coveralls that we used in the Marine Corps, except all of the patches would be velcro, not just the name tag. It comes with both Maverick and Goose name tags so you can choose your poison. It is quite warm, would be pretty good for an outdoor party. I read in another review that the included glasses are plastic, so I ordered another pair of glasses. However, in the package I received, the glasses are metal, and seem to be pretty good quality. As far as fit, I'm 5'7\" 155 lbs athletic build, and the S/M fits almost perfectly. The legs are a little long, but it's barely noticeable in combat boots. My biggest concern was the shoulder width and the crotch, both of which are perfectly sized. The front zipper is a two way zipper, so hitting the head after a few adult beverages isn't a hassle, as you don't have to take the suit off. Zippers are high quality, and similar to those on actual flight suits. Now, the reasons I gave this costume 4 instead of 5 stars. As I previously stated, the legs are just a hair too long, like maybe an inch or two. If I were 5'8 or 5'9, I don't think it'd be an issue at all. Pocket placement is slightly disappointing. There are no hip pockets, which means I have to adjust for placement of my phone and keys. Also, there is no back pocket, but that speaks to authenticity. There are a total of 5 pockets in the suit, two chest, one thigh, and two lower leg. They're all pretty roomy, but the thigh pocket goes just a bit deep, as anything I put in it hits my knee. Not really an issue, just an observation. I also wish the velcro on the cuff of the sleeve extended just a bit further, as the sleeves are a little loose when all the way down. Overall, this is a great costume. I'm venturing through my city's bar district on Halloween in it, and I'm happy there is no restricted motion and I'm comfortable wearing it for hours. I would certainly recommend this to anyone."

Chiefly I believe that the problem is that you get what you pay for, but these ripped left and right with light regular use which should not have happened. I constantly had to repair them after every show, and the opaque top section fell a bit low and needed to be altered for modesty in order to adequately cover the girls so to speak. Unfortunately I cannot provide photos of the girls in the costumes as it against my company's policy, but they did look wonderful in them which is definitely worth noting. All in all, use your best judgement with these. If you've got quick changes I do NOT recommend these as that's where most of the rips happened for my girls, but again I must emphasize that it ripped in ways that a garment should not with basic seam work quality."

The stretch material is great and the skirts are very comfortable and for the price you can't beat it. It seemed the black is a lighter material. The skirts length is a little above the knee (I am 5'6\"). I may buy the dark gray next.

Constantly having to adjust things gets annoying. So in comes these bikini underwear and wow what a difference. The best clothes are the ones you don't even realize you are wearing and I don't even feel them. These have excellent support to male anatomy, so things are stable which is great and very comfortable. And whats nice is there's some style to these as well. I detest tighty whities type of brief underwear and up until now, I thought that was the only option for guys was boxers or tighty whities. Bikini underwear is where its at. They are sleek and I just appreciate how they look in addition to how they feel. In addition I LOVE they these no more bunching up or riding of boxers. I put on jeans and I just put them on. No more having to push boxers down into the jeans. When I sleep I just sleep. No more having to adjust boxers that are shifting, bunching and riding. I'm an OCD person and these just bring peace of mind. They just fit comfortable and I don't have to think about them."

The style is slightly too brief for my liking, but it's difficult to find this general style these days - and the price was right. The fit is too tight, there is no shape at the front, making for an uncomfortable wear. I try to wear them a couple of times a week but it feels good going back to my fuller-styled and looser-fitting ones. It's strange that XL is the largest size - if you usually wear medium those might just fit."

The print includes shadowing on the backside in all the right places and the waist line is not too tight or loose (it does come to mid-drift). I was originally going to pair them with a black or white tutu but after trying them on, I will not be since I don't want to cover the detains....I would highly recommend this item! Not only was the shipping quick, the price was under $20 and it being true to size/exactly as described, I'm very pleased that I ordered them for my unique and custom made Halloween costume this year!"

The material was real flimsy on one of them, the sleeves didn't go all the way down the arm... Ok, I probably shouldn't have bought from a guy in the parking lot, but still. I had like 6 beers at the game, LeBron had just come back. It was a good night. Except for the crappy sweater I bought. In any case, I'm not disappointed at all with this one! It fits great, has a really nice, comfortable feel to it. It even smells nice! I know that's weird, but when I opened it, I was like \"Man, that is a nice smell!\" The hood keeps my ears warm. Now the challenge is convincing my wife to keep her hands off it. (She steals all of my sweaters - including the parking lot one, but she can keep that one). This one's all mine, baby!

With 200 dollars, he bought a sewing machine, some rubber & started his goal: To make the best sandal. He officially began Rainbow Sandals, Inc in 1974. Today, we make 2 million pairs a year. Our goal has always been to make a quality product that will not end up as landfill and that goal does not end when our sandals leave the store. 48 years later, our Rainbow Sandals Factory Outlet is still located at 326 Calle de Los Molinos, San Clemente, CA.

      "text": "Overall decent quality typical school style backpack. I am concerned the screws that hold the handlebar to the wheeled base are so short as to eventually become unstable. They handlebar moves about in it’s housing too much because the one tiny screw holding it in place is not sufficient to keep it stable. “Walks” up stairs very smoothly with the 6 wheel base. Decent handle height for most average height kids even into teens. Adjustable height for shorter/younger children. Locks in bag to the base via sturdy plastic clip system. Backpack straps tuck away (you have to adjust out to longest length to do so). I especially appreciate the bag is completely removable from the wheeled base so it can be used more comfortably when wheeling is not necessary (the lightly padded back cover is decent but not something one wants to keep strapped on their back for more than a few minutes, especially as the top of the handlebar remains exposed to the upper back/neck of your child’s body.)"

The wheels also make this backpack much easier to navigate when going up or down stairs. The description is accurate - this is really a product bundle. You have a normal black backpack plus you have a detached 6-wheel (3 wheel per side) trolley / dolly. The backpack has a sleeve on the back where the dolly slides through and the backpack rests on the bottom of the dolly. If you had a different backpack with a sleeve (open at the top and bottom) it could also work in as a replacement. The backpack came from China. It is not a known American brand. However, so far we love it."

      "text": "This is the most beautiful dress. We are going to a wedding and my daughter needed a formal dress. You must measure your chest or bust size because if you have a bust and/or the swimmers back with a bust you will be ordering a larger size than normally you would order. If you have to order a couple sizes for trying them on to find the right fit, it is easy to print out a return label to return the ones that did not fit. There were two of us that saw her in the dress right after she tried it on and we were delighted. We may have caught our breath. LOL. It is ethereal. So, if you are a wedding guest, a bridesmaid, going to a formal, a great party, even the bride, you could make this dress work in the color you desire. Measure your chest, order a size up, leave time for it to arrive and then hem it based on if you want a long formal or shorter dress etc. Blessings to all! It has a slight train; but, you could have it hemmed so it looks like you are floating when you are walking! 😉😁🎉"

It is low cut so that is something to think about but with the right bra is wasn’t an issue. I am glad that I listened to the other reviews and I ordered a size up. I am 5’4”, 165lbs and a large fit perfect. The length was just a tad bit long but with a little bit of heels that was solved. This dress definitely did not disappoint! I can’t wait to have another occasion to wear it to!"

Probé “borrar” las marcas como indica en la descripción (frotando con un paño seco) y si funciona 👏 fácilmente se convertirá en mi bolsa para el diario; es espaciosa (si no te gustan las bolsas grandes, no es para ti) tiene compartimientos y divisiones que ayudan a mantener organizadas las pertenencias. Las asas son muy cómodas. Si la encuentran a buen precio, anímense! No se arrepentirán. Agregó una fotografía comparándola con la Melissa shopper y no hay mucha diferencia en el tamaño."

L'espace est parfaite, elle tient bien debout. L'étiquette de 398$ était encore dessus alors que j'ai été chanceuse de la payer beaucoup moins cher, bref je recommande cette compagnie Frye pour la qualité, la beauté, la solidité.

      "text": "Runs small. I usually wear a medium (for stretchy clothes) or large (for cotton and denim). I ordered large thinking this would be safe. Noe. It was very, very tight. The return policy is absolutely amazing and efficient. I received a response in what felt like minutes but I'm sure it was much longer. They sent me a UPS label to print. I took the garment to UPS and before I knew it I received An email saying they already processed my refund and it should hit my account in 3 business days. You can't exchange, so I ordered an xlarge when I returned from UPS. It arrived two days later and fit perfectly. My second garment was missing the thong but I'd already ordered a sexy pair of panties to go with the outfit so it was a moot point to me. Oh, I also bought pasties which were 5 pairs for a very reasonable price. If you want to blow your partner's mind try doing what I did that left my husband speechless. I bathed, left some crotchless pants on the bed for my husband with a note that told him to put them on and go sit in the family room with his cell phone and wait for a text from me. I went into the bathroom put on make up, the outfit, black pasties with tassels, the new panties I bought and red 3 inch red heels. I wrapped myself in a cloak, went to the front door and sent my husband a dirty text to answer the door. He opened the door with a baffled look on his face and invited me in. When he removed my cloak he was behind me and already raving the outfit. When I turned around he just stared until he found his voice. It was amazing. We had a wonderful evening of exploring each other. I can definitely recommend this product. I Iive on acrage so using my front door is safe. You'll have to work out your own special entrance but I guarantee it will be worth the effort. Oh the panties I bought were from Amazon named Women's Rose C-Shape C-String Thong Mesh... They aren't something you'll wear for a long period of time but you'll get a positive response from your partner for the short time you have them on."

Once we pulled the strings it got shorter. Like it didn’t even come to my waste so that meant my little pudge would show unless I wore high waste pants It’s ok just not the sexiness I was looking for. Maybe once I put the outfit together it will look different Ok update - i found a different shaper that is a bit sexier and it fits I had to get a size 3x in this particular style but I also have a 2x coming so between the 2 I will see which fits better on the other style"

I took it out of the box and tightened the ribbons completely in the back. I was pretty shocked when zipping it up, it was actually a little tight in the chest area (nothing ever is). So thank you to the manufacturers for realizing even women that are part of the A-Team still like to dress up and look sexy. The bottom part that v's is really loose, but I can live with that. Because I'm so small-breasted, this didn't give me much cleavage, but I easily remedied that by wearing a push-up gel bra and a padded cami underneath (yes, the cami's over the gel bra and the corset's over that). Anyhow, I have the look I was going for! There are several threads that needed to be trimmed, but overall, a great purchase for the price."

On the skin it's a perfect fit, but over clothing (like a T-shirt or a blouse), it fits well. It definitely gives a great shape. As a busty woman, I'm glad to have a open-bust corset it means I can breathe and play! We'll see how it holds up. The version I have is the lace-up back, with silver-clipped front, and open chest, but has shoulder straps. It seems all the versions are reviewed here, so I wanted to give a full review. I had the corset on over a T-shirt while wearing leggings when a guy complimented me on it. That's how fast this gets compliments!"

      "text": "This corset came before the delivery date which is awesome. Its made pretty well and tightens up nicely. The only complaint I have is the bust area is pretty enormous. You would have to have DD size tits if you want to fill this thing out. The roominess isn't a real problem for me though, since I can sew, I was just going to take the middle bones on the front of the corset on either side and overlap them over the 1st bones closest to the zipper and secure in place with either a rivet or sew them in. that would take care of the extra space. Overall this is a great corset. If I do buy again from this seller I would suggest women who are less busty buy a size down. I usually wear a medium but What I really needed was a size small. As with all corsets this corset does feature laces and tightens nicely. The shape itself comes down in a slight V shape towards your crotch. I know it sounds iffy me telling people out there to buy a size smaller than what they are but listen. Corsets were invented to give you and hourglass figure and make you look smaller. Therefore women would buy smaller corsets. You want something that's going to hold you in and shape you. If you buy a corset that is already your measurements then you cant tighten it to mold to your body. If you buy slightly smaller you can do that because its not your exact measurements. I hope this review has been helpful to all of you guys out there."

She is 5'2\" and 140-150lbs, 38B with 34-37\" waist. Based on the reviews we purchased a 2XL. Others indicated that perhaps we should even go to a 3XL and I'm glad we didn't. The material is stretchy and there are laces for adjustments at the back. She fit this very well, but it is meant to be a corset look and there isn't much of an option to tighten it as it is a perfect fit. She would have been fine with an XL, it would have been tighter and the laces would need to be loosened. She is fine with a 2XL, but a 3XL would have been too big. It looks smart, faux leather shine to it. Really perfect for its purpose. Hope this helps!"

There is A LOT of extra fabric in the front and back and they’re just too big for me in every place that should be snug. I had a baby last year and am lucky to not have stretch marks at all or a mom pooch anymore. I think this would be great to cover up any stretch marks but probably won’t do you any good with squeezing everything in."

      "text": "I had my eye on this jacket for a couple of months, and once went it went on sale, I was so excited. I am generally average size everything (5'6\", 160). Previously HH midlayer crew jacket in large size fit well, I checked the size chart for this jacket and ordered the large so I could comfortably wear layers underneath. When I got the jacket, the sleeves were abnormally long - covering my hands except the very tips of my fingernails. I could push up the sleeves and tighten the cuffs so my hands were more free, but there was a lot of material bunching up my arms, which isn't comfortable or ideal long term. Because I loved this jacket design so much I ordered it in a medium, thinking it was a size issue with the large. Same problem! Though I could now see the first digits of my fingers, the fit was so off it was unusable. Never in the past have I had an issue with arm length on a jacket, so this surprised me. I compared both sizes and could see that something was off in the design/cut, it wasn't designed to fit women well, or perhaps the odd bunching around the armpits and overly long sleeves is to be expected for Helly Hansen's more technical jackets. Looking closer at the photos of the models wearing the jacket, on some you can see similar bunching of the sleeves indicating same problem, so this looks to be a flaw with this particular design, unfortunately. My old sailing jacket of similar type is from Gill and fits much better, so reluctantly due to fit issues decided to return both sizes of the Helly Hansen. Otherwise the jacket was great - loved the design, materials, and quality but the fit issues rendered it unwearable for me (3 stars)"

      "text": "This review of the Bavarian Boy costume, is for college students or young adults. It comes in different sizes, it has a unique quality and it is for those on a budget. The costume comes in three different types of sizes small, medium and large. How you determine which size to get is based on pants size. When trying on the outfit it may occur to you the socks slide down too much or the shirt is too big. The shirt is supposed to be a little loose, so it will be a little free in the arm when dancing. The socks do have the tendency to slide down often when, jumping, dancing or walking to fast. This costume is stylish and can make you look like a true Bavarian Boy. It is comfy and smooth. The shirt is almost like a silk feeling and the pants also have a thin silk feeling. However, if you plan on being outside on a cold day or night it will not keep be warm enough. I would recommend wearing something under the shirt and possibly warmer socks. If dancing is on the agenda or trying to be flexible you will want to be careful because the material may rip. I wore it two days in a row and by the end of the second day I had a hole on the side of the pants (easily sewed back up) and one of the straps ripped off (again easily sewn back on). Because of the low-price the material is not durable when doing more than standing, walking or sitting. For the people who are living on a budget it is an inexpensive costume that you do not have to make. It was very convenient and arrived on time before the weekend started. Other Bavarian Boy costumes may be too expensive because they are trying to be more authentic. Then there is a T-shirt that has straps printed on them, and that does not look good. If you want something that looks like a real Bavarian Boy, and paying for an authentic one is out of the price range. Then this is a great choice. In general this costume works. Easy to find the right size, and not going to hurt the wallet. Hopefully this review has helped in making your decision."

      "text": "The costume overall served its purpose. My boyfriend and I went as a German couple for a Halloween party and he wore this. It looks exactly like the picture! Sizing: just as many other reviews have stated, the costume is very big and you will need to size down 1/2 or 1 whole size approximately. My boyfriend wears a Large in everything and a 33/32 in pants, is 6' 2\" and 180 lbs and we ordered a Medium and it fit almost perfectly! The suspenders on the shorts are not adjustable and therefore we couldn't fix the shorts so that they weren't pulled up as high as they were...this left his, um, man parts almost inappropriate looking and slightly awkward/uncomfortable for him. The size of the shorts themselves was great! The material is a tad bit thin and in some lightly could almost be see-through but we were in a dark garage and it was fine. The material feels \"costume-like\" as you would expect but not uncomfortable. The hat is as everyone has said - wrinkled and a little bit awkward, but we pressed it with an iron as best as possible and he wore it and it looked good. The shirt is very thin and the material \"costume-like\" as you would expect but a tad bit more silky, and the ribbon on it is cheap but what do you expect for such a cheap costume? You can substitute it with a dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up to your elbows to get the same effect. The socks are a bit thin but he wore a pair underneath to keep his feet warm at the garage party we were at. They were also a lot shorter than it shows in the picture but it worked out either way. Overall definitely worth the $26.30 we paid for it! Great costume and went well with mine! :)"

I have very broad shoulders and the shirt fit well. Well worth it. You just need to expect to make a few simple modifications. My advice... The socks are worthless and the suspenders are short as well, both of these issues are mentioned in other reviews so was prepared. A quick trip to Walmart produced some short alligator clip extensions to the suspenders. I threw out the socks immediately because they are super thin and flimsy and too small to fit size 13 feet, and instead wore some off-white Smartwool hiking socks with hiking boots. If you want, do what I do and glue a big red feather to the hat. The hat is a little small but that only enhances the comedic value of the outfit. And it's not uncomfortable. So yes you may have to do a few things, but they take minutes and overall buying this was way easier and authentic looking than trying to create something from scratch. I am tempted to give it 5 stars based on value alone, but realize some people may expect a 5 star rating to mean perfect out of the box."

The only way to use this is to go to a seamstress to cut the 4 attachments, find some materials so it does not look too bad and extend the suspenders or cut them and buy Bavarian suspenders.

In the off chance your wife books a last minute charity fun run and you find yourself needing a pair these work great. They arrived quickly and fit the bill perfect. Not only did we cross the finish line in second place we were voted best costumes and won first place as a team for that. The sizing is large though for the lederhosen. I ordered an X-large which is my usual shirt size but found these a bit too big."

      "text": "I've been buying Victoria Secret bras for the past 13 years due to a friend who took me there, and once I bought one I was hooked. I use to buy cheap bras at local stores till I was introduced to VS. But sadly lately I can not afford to cough out 40+ bucks per bra. So I typed in top bras for larger chests in 2019 and the 2nd listed was this one. So i bought it with the hopes I snagged a good deal and everything feeling like it was back in harmony since I only had one VS bra left. My last 3 bras, the metal band broke through. The issue I see is the strap which goes under the arms and clasps together on the back, is no where near as long as a bra that would be fit for someone with a large bust. I wear a 38 D and I compared bra to bra. I am comparing a non push up VS bra with this one and the cup from the VS seems to cover a bit more. It felt more like a circle but where this one is slightly cut off at an angle at the top. The part that wraps around and clasps at the back is missing a big amount. If you take the part that has all the sets of loops on it, and add that same amount on top of that, thats about how long the VS is just on that side. The other side with the hooks that goes into the loops, is missing even more. I wouldnt even go a size up, because i have a feeling the band would be the same. It feels like they put 38D cups on a regular A size band. So more of my sides are being pushed out and over the bra under my armpit. I made sure to adjust the shoulder straps and no matter what I did, it feels like the cup is still being forced against my breast. It doesnt feel like my bust is resting in the cup, it feels like the cup is trying to suffocate my breast. If i wear a big loose shirt, im sure it wont be as visible, but trying to wear a cute tight top with this will not work. 2 stars for the very soft feel of the material. It feels comfy against my skin. Its snug so im not sure how long I would be willing to wear it. Since I just got it in the mail I wanted to see how one would fit before washing. I tried the white one first and thought maybe it was just slightly tighter. I have bought clothing before where one color was tighter than the others. But no. The other two I bought, for a total of three, were all the same. The other two were the Back Heather color. Not sure why the black heather is called that since it looks all grey. Hardly looks black to me compared to the image. This bra will have to be worn with bulky big shirts or around the house. I will keep my last VS bra hidden away for special occasions until I have to painfully cough up money for a new one. Wont buy the Hanes bra again. I wish a better experience for those looking for a better price. I know not everyones body is the same so some people this might work and others not so much. Just fair warning if the VS strap that goes below your armpit and around your back works for you, this one may be too short. I had this one hooked on the very last one where as with the VS I could hook it on the 2nd one on the inside, out of the four rows of clasps. Best of luck. Hope this information helps others looking for a cheaper solution, and avoiding this one is they need a larger band that goes around the the back. **Image Provided** This is the comparison side by side. The black bra is my VS bra 38D and the white one is the Hanes 38D. You can see how much length is missing for the strap that wraps around to the back is not there on the Hanes bra."

I like these because of the width fitting, they are wide, which is what I wanted but then they are unisex which may be why, love the colour and of course the crocs cushiony springy comfort, like walking on air. Also nice for British summer as they are waterproof. Birkenstocks tend to get soggy on the dewy and wet grass and I love my birkenstocks. Nice to ease me back into walking more as lockdown eases 😊 aesthetically crocs are a bit marmite and well I love marmite too so there you go ☺️ I would say crocs are chunky but funky and incredibly lightweight."

I normally wear a size UK 8 Male and so, after looking at the size chart (which I did not really understand ) I ordered a pair of UK8 which is an M9. When I received them, I saw that the size was a 7M/9W. I measured them against my others and they were the same size. They fit really well and are soft without being too soft. I would recommend these sandals, but ,as everybody says, be careful with the sizing."

I’m 5’7 with a 29” inseam and these are the perfect length with running shoes (based on what I think looks good). The pants are no more than an inch off the ground when I have runners on. I really dislike when pants only come up to my ankles. The thickness is a good - not too thick to be very hot, but also thick enough to not show every bump and keep your legs warm enough in the winter when going from the car into work in the snow. They haven’t shrunk at all yet, but I let them air dry every night and throw them in the dryer for 20-30 minutes in the morning to finish drying them and get the wrinkles out."

These give me the same ability. The material of the tops is really pliable and comfortable. They were comfortable the first ride I took with them and I felt like they transmitted more power to the pedals. Probably because the fit was so good but just my perception and not documented with a power meter. I have seen some posts where they say the pad at the back of the shoe wears too quick. I have not seen that on my other pair of sidi shoes that I used for two years with the pads showing wear but nothing serious. In any case I put some shoe goo on them and put them back on. when that wears through I will just apply more. Not sure how much those replacements are but I do not understand how the person who post I saw replaces several a year. These were worth the price as I tried to get away with some lower cost shoes even some that are a name brand shoe but none have the feel of these."

The Genius is aptly named. So many thoughtful touches and ideas are incorporated into them. I cannot imagine ever needing another pair. Solid, comfortable, almost infinitely adjustable, stiff where they need to be and flexible everywhere else, the quality of the design and build is matched only by the high quality of the materials.

I suspect that has a lot to do with fit. The 42.5 (8 1/2) fit me like a glove with some welcome wiggle room in the toe box. I was new to the Double Techno-3 Push cable lacing mechanism. It does take a little getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, there is no going back. The micro-adjusting is really nice. I use these shoes with Look Delta cleats on Look PP-396 pedals, which I swear by. The whole set up provides a very high level of performance and comfort. I buy new biking shoes roughly every 10 years. The Sidi Genius 10 are so worthy of the investment. I expect to get great use of them."

The shape flatters my full oval face and large features, but I think the style will look great on just about anyone. It offers great sun protection; the brim is generous but not cumbersome. It is substantial and not too floppy. Hopefully, it will not lose its shape in a suitcase. I love how I look in it; finding a flattering beach hat is harder than it seems. The only other style that I like is Scala Medium Brim. Glad to have taken a chance on this one!"

Fits above the waist and does not roll down. Very comfortable. I wash in cold water, gentle cycle, no fabric softener and hang dry. They come out perfect. They hold up well.

There are no outside pockets, (just pockets on the shorts) which I think keeps the silhouette nice and clean. I’m 5’4” with a 35” waist and 42” hips.

I got a lot of compliment thanks to those shoes, but what I like the most is actually the comfort. Such shoes are most of the time very rigid, the sole very thin and worse than everything else, my feet's humidity level make it impossible to wear for more than few hours. That's not the case for these shoes, I wear them when it rains and when it's sunny, and I never had humidity issue. I really like these shoes, I may order them in black too."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2022",
      "text": "As a retired elite athlete, I have worn many different models, through so many training hours and races, and frankly, some of the models I have used have, well, pretty much stunk. Not enough support, too much support, too revealing, too much padding. If you are an active athlete, then you know what I am talking about. It seems as if so many sports bras are made for the gym, and not for the road. For those of us that swim-bike-run for 20 hours a week - or more - we need something that will give us enough support, but not feel as if we were being slowly strangled by a python. The name of this bra caught my eye, the fabric and designs looked well thought out, and the styles looked good. And more importantly, they seemed as if they would support me and not choke me. And I was right - the strapping system holds everything in place, but doesn't chafe me if I go out for a 3 hour run, or a 5 hour bike ride. When you hold it in your hands it has a very solid feel. The stitching is first rate, with no loose threads. The pads are a bit thicker than most, but are flatter, and don't make the bra look as if you are not wearing any pads at all. They are easy to remove and wash, and after repeated use, have not warped or worn out. The colors of the fabric have not run, either. And have held up to the hot Florida sun and humidity. I have bought two of these, and tried on several of the other styles, and they all fit me, true to size. The blue color criss-cross has easily seen 120 hours of use, and has lost none of it's stretch. I would recommend these highly for anyone that is an endurance athlete. My next race is a 30K in January, and I will be wearing a Running Girl Sports Bra when I line up at the starting line. I trust it that much!"

Theyre comfortable enough to just wear around the house but supportive enough to wear under a t shirt to the store. I have 40DD and wear a xxl in this bra. I’ve laundered them many times on gentle and they’re still perfect. The pads are removable but they stay in place so I have them in still. These would be great for yoga, walking. But probably not enough support for running or heavy workout especially if you are large chested. Great everyday sports bra."

I’m a CNA and wore this bra all day -12 hour shifts. Towards the end of my shift the seam on my shoulder was becoming extremely painful. I kept trying to shift the straps to new positions - which is embarrassing and massively inconvenient. I’ll happily wear this bra for short periods of time until they (hopefully!) start putting the seam a few inches down on the back side of the bra."

I have a physical job where I use my body to lift things which is why I won’t wear a bra with any type of plastic parts & this offers awesome support no uní-boob & the straps on my shoulders are thick and therefore comfy."

      "text": "When they are new, you can't beat the price, fit & finish of these lenses. They just seem to wear out fast. The coating on the lenses comes off way too easy. I have purchased a few of these and will most likely purchase more only because I love my Oakleys but am too cheap to pay Oakley prices for OEM lenses ($90 and up). My most recent Mryok lens didn't last a week before the coating started coming off. I don't expect them to be as good as OEM, but should last longer than a week. The pictures are from today, July 17. The lenses were purchased on May 22. In the close up, you can see how the coating transferred from the lens to the frames just from cleaning. Just as a little tip - I find the Oakley cleaning cloth is safer to clean these lenses than the one provided. The one provided feels nice but does remove the coating if not ULTRA careful. Also, don't take them in the pool or ocean as this will hasten the coating removal."

Perfect for out on the water! Viewing out of the bottom or top of the lenses gives more of an amber hue and made that lake water amazingly clear this morning. These Myrok lenses blow Oakley mariner lenses OUT OF THE WATER. I've already received several compliments and inquiries out at the lake. Great job Myrok!!"

      "text": "Pros: Price. Cleaning cloth included. Cons: Fitment The high star rating got me. Great price as compared to Oakley’s $80 MSRP which is why I give it 3 stars. Fit, well that’s another story. It is not perfect. These are slightly smaller than the stock Oakley lense. Once popped in they barely held on (they do hold - barely) and minimal pressure will pop them right back out. This is most noticable while wiping the lense clean with a cloth. The slight amount of pressure your fingers apply while cleaning them is enough to have them pop out. The old adage of “You get what you pay for” applies perfectly here. If you’re ok with a 98% fit - for the price - these are for you."

Stractch resistance is better than oakley in my opinion. I lost my m-frame at the beach a few weeks ago and my back up was my oakley turbine rotor. I did not like the pink tint that it came with and now was a great time to upgrade the lenses. The myrok lenses fit the frame well and look great! I recommend them to people."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 11, 2021",
      "text": "I rarely write reviews, but this review may help someone else out there who’s going through similar issues... I’ve been recovering from a severe traumatic brain injury (which turned into severe neuro issues) for many years. To help ease the “pain” and effects of LED and fluorescent lights (and general light sensitivity), I have been wearing polarized sunglasses everywhere. The last pair I had, I bought from W-mart. They were ok - did the job, but very heavy and did not fit well at all. When the polarized glaze started to wear off, I looked online for a better brand of fishing glasses (typically the best source for polarized sunglasses). I found these and decided to give them a try. They are amazing! Although large for my very small head, it’s so worth wearing them! I am in the very small percentage of people who get physically sick the instant I put on “blue blocking glasses”, but these did the opposite. They are blue on the outside of the lenses, but they are not “blue block” glasses. My neurologist has had me try many different colored glasses to see what would help. These are the first in a long line that have helped my symptoms stay at bay (headaches, dizziness, wobbly/jerky walking, disconnectedness from right side limbs). I can even shop inside multiple stores in a day without needing to collapse into bed in the dark/quiet when I get home! I wear them as much as possible through the day - watch tv, clean, cook, drive (so awesome!), even put them over my reading glasses for the ipad (my head is very small, so I can do that - they probably won’t fit like that for most). I think part of the design in the Iditarod style that helps me is the light blocking from the sides (peripheral vision problems) - I can turn my head in all directions without getting dizzy. KastKing, thank you for helping me find more independence and relief. Your glasses may not have been designed for people like me, but they feel like a miracle!"

      "text": "Y’all!!!! These literally just made the biggest difference I did not expect! Did a trial run of packing with and without these impressive compression cubes and let me tell you… I’m blown away! Just experienced a travel nightmare back in June for a domestic flight from Dallas to Chicago and I’m not about to go through that again! Preparing for upcoming trip overseas to Greece and want to only have my carry-on and under seat bag for a week and a half worth of clothes, shoes, toiletries and cosmetics, straightener and extra stuff. Reviews really help me make up my mind so I’m going to be pretty specific in the list below of what I was able to get into my 20 inch carry-on. Largest cube: One pair of jeans, three leggings, to crop pants, three wide leg linen crop pants, to Capri leggings Medium size cube 1: three jersey cotton maxi dresses, OnE sleeveless chiffon maxi dress, One romper, One swimsuit cover (long), pajama sleep shirt Medium size cube 2: 4 sleeveless tunic tops, to under Armour V-neck athletic tees, 3 short sleeve tops, 1 3/4 Sleeve top, 1 Long sleeve eyelet cotton top, 1 Long sleeve chiffon wrap top Small size cube 1: 2 under armor athletic shorts, 2 bike shorts, pajama top and bottom set, 2 short sleeve T-shirt dress Small size cube 2: two sport bras, One wireless T-shirt bra, 4 no show sock pears, 4 Bikini briefs, 6 thongs, 1 Long sleeve cardigan, 1 3/4 sleeve cardigan Holy crap you guys! It all fit in my small carry-on! I did it a couple of ways until I figured out the best way to fold each item… For me rolling seem to take up more space despite what other reviewer‘s have mentioned. After placing each of the cubes I still had room for two pair of sandals and one pair of slip on espadrilles. So extremely impressed and yes as an over packer this is a huge game changer! I went back on and bought a three piece set to use for my under seat bag which will hold they set of clothes as well as cosmetics and toiletries and electronics etc.. An international trip without having to check a bag! Worth every penny! The material seems very sturdy and well-made. Zippers and stitching seem very sturdy and best of all it works! I will buy another set for my husband… One thing to take note he is 6’2 220 lbs where I am only 5’3” so his clothes will likely take up more space as they are bigger and more material. Still totally worth it though for the true difference it makes!"

      "text": "These were a must for a recent trip. Flying a budget airline and not wanting to pay for a carry on required stuffing a lot of clothes in a backpack. I tried another brand of compression packing cubes and they didn't work at all. The SuitedNomad ones did offer a fair amount of compression, plus the benefit of organization and the ability to remove the clothes easily to access other items in the backpack. Don't fill them too full or you won't be able to compress them. I think I got it just about right, having to wrestle just a little with them to fully close the compression zipper. And once closed, the zipper stayed closed and there were no signs of stressed seams. They do not compress flat; meaning they will be rather bulgy as the sides compress more than the middle (which is how they all are). The darker colors do help disguise the contents which is nice. I would give them 4.5 stars if that was an option but decided to round up to 5 because in my experience, they are superior to comparable products."

      "text": "I'm only hesitant to give it a perfect review because I'm unsure about its long term durability. The zippers aren't the most heavy duty and the design of the bags mean that the expand/collapse zipper is prone to catch the fabric, I already had this happen once while testing these out. It does achieve both stated purposes: 1.) Organize clothes within a suitcase, and 2.) Compress clothes to make it easier to stuff clothes for more days in a small space. After a little time trying these out, here's my tips and tricks: - When zipping up the expand/collapse zipper, I like to leave a good gap on the open/close zipper to make it easier to push out air. Also, make sure the fabric inside the expand/collapse zipper is fully out of the way while zipping up. As mentioned it's prone to getting caught. - These bags *do* have limits, and as long as enough space is being saved, not everything has to go in them. I personally just put gym shorts, shirts, socks, and boxer-briefs in them since those are the easiest to compress. - Most importantly, it takes more time and effort to use these bags than just straight throwing clothes into a suitcase. I got myself the 3-piece, Large-Large-Medium set and timed myself taking 38 seconds to zip up the medium bag and 48 seconds for the large bag, so the math comes out to over 2 minutes just to zip up the cubes. Also, it takes more time to roll up everything vs just folding it. This could be an issue in a rushed situation. Saving space needs to be weighed against convenience. The photos I posted show that I managed to shove 10 days into a 20 x 13 inch (50.8 x 33 cm) carry-on when normally 7 days is the limit, which is nice, but if I know that I can do laundry during the trip I would prefer just to pack 7 days or less normally."

Once at the hotel, everything stayed organized during the weekend instead of having one big pile of clothes in the bag. My wife prefers to unpack all of her clothes at the hotel and these helped with that too. The fabric was lightweight but so far very well stitched. The extra zipper really does give a little more compression than those without it. Overall the best compression packing cubes on Amazon!"

Yes, they are expensive but they last a really long time & can be repaired when they get really beat up. I have lost count of just how many pairs I own but I think I have at least 10 pairs. I had Plantar Fasciitis many years ago and I require good arch support to keep it from reoccurring. I have never had problem since I started wearing these. They do take some getting used to if you have not worn Birkenstocks before & they do require a little \"break in\" time but it is well worth the effort. I can't speak for other styles of Birkenstocks but I can say that the Gizeh runs really big so SIZE DOWN. I wear 7-1/2 or 8M in shoes but in these I wear 37 which they describe as size 6. I'm no size 6 but I can tell you that even though I'm usually 7-1/2 or 8, every pair of Birkenstocks Gizehs I have are size 37M and they fit me like they were custom made for me. FYI, Birkenstock has recently started making an EVA version of the Gizeh which is pretty much like rubber flip flops but they are practically as comfortable as the $100 ones, still have great arch support, can get as wet as you want and they cost a fraction of the price. You should be able to find them for around $40. Again, really expensive for flip flops but although I don't know how long they last, I think they are worth the price."

A year ago, I bought my first pair of Birks (Florida) and have worn them exclusively around the house ever since. They have been the answer to my prayers. This year, I wanted to try a different style and I chose this Gizeh sandal. They actually make my old feet look cute! The break in period was a bit painful due to the really stiff toe post that has no give. But I didn’t want to give up on them. So a week later, my feet have fully accepted the toe post and my floppy arches are in love with the arch supports built into Birkenstock footbeds! If you’re on the fence, I urge you to try the Gizeh!!!"

      "text": "First of all, I have wanted a pair of these for years and could never justify the price tag from the original source. I was sceptical when I found these on amazon as they are very well reduced from the normal price and wondered if they were fake. I scoured the reviews and couldn't really find any evidence to suggest they are, so hey bonus! The second worry I had was the size. I am a 6.5 but normally have to size up to a 7 as hardly anywhere does half sizes, again after reading all the reviews I took the advice and ordered a 5.5, cursing myself as I did it, expecting them to arrive and have to be sent back straight away. Fast forward to today when they arrive, they are in proper birkenstock packaging, they look and feel very sturdy, the name on the side is nice and clear everything suggests that they are the real McCoy. Next test is trying them on.. and they fit!! Now they say they are a 39 so I guess you could say that they are a 6 rather than a 5.5 but either way, I certainly wouldn't be able to cram feet in to a 6. They feel secure and comfortable enough and as I've read they will get more comfortable over time. So it's a long winded 5 star review, am absolutely made up with my purchase.. well done Amazon"

As with all new Birkenstocks, they need 'breaking in' as the sole needs to soften as it starts to mould to your own feet. My older pair are like gloves, so perservere with wearing a new pair indoors for an hour or so at a time, building up until they feel just right. I live in them, spring through to autumn, so highly recommend."

DovEggs accept the personalized customization if you provide us more details of customization. How To Measure Your Ring Size? Method for reference ONLY: This guide offers two methods of measuring for your ring size. If you already own a ring or have managed to obtain one from the person that you are buying the ring for, simply measure the inside diameter of the ring and match the size to the chart. If you don't have a ring, simply measure the intended ring finger and match the measurement to the chart. Tips for measuring your ring size： If using a ring to measure, ensure that you select a ring that fits the intended ring finger If measuring a finger, measure towards the end of the day when the finger is warm.When your fingers are cold there can be up to half a size difference Rings that have a thicker band feel tighter than those that have a thinner band.If buying a thicker band, look to buy a full ring size bigger to allow room for movement Your ring should always fit comfortably on finger without any fear of it falling off.

I have a 36 waist and it gives me maybe 3 spare holes but this is only maybe 4 inches of belt."

It zips up the back and is made of a stretchy black material. I noticed when I was in the sunlight that it’s rather see through so I would suggest adding a slip if you plan on wearing this in the daytime. It’s not the worst dress I’ve ever gotten and I will keep it as a back up. Just know that the quality is only mediocre before you spend the money on this dress."

I can’t go without a bra because I don’t have perky boobs and they are a little uneven so I am limited in tops I can wear and always have a challenge when wearing dresses, but not anymore. I usually wear size 38D and this was true to size. It is tight but I think that’s how it works, still comfortable though!!"

I can run and my girls stay in place. Cons: I dried my first pair in the drying machine and for what was that?!! The shape of the bra on the top part is cripple and does not hug my girls anymore. The shape will never be the same. But the instructions clearly say to air dry! So I bought another pair cuz I like the way it fits so much! I now air dry my bras. I’m a 34B for reference I weigh 110lbs on a good day :) and recently breastfed two babies so my girls need all the support they can get!"

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2020",
      "text": "***Sorry in advance, Amazon jumbled up my photos for whatever reason 😂 BACKSTORY: I usually wear a 34D (used to be a 34DD but apparently they shrank after having a kid 😂) and I needed a strapless bra for a bridesmaid dress so I researched them for DAYS. I basically loath wearing certain types of bras and I own numerous Victoria Secret bras including strapless and multiway bras, have a few backless strapless adhesive bras, cups that could be sewn into the dress and even silicone chicken cutlet looking inserts that have all proven to be mediocre, a waste of time, not supportive enough, horribly uncomfortable on hot days (yes, adhesive bras do hold in all your sweat and loose their grip not to mention they are DISGUSTING to take off) so yea, you can say I've pretty much tried everything on the market. I will say I was extremely hesitant purchasing this bra because of its expensive price tag but I can tell you in the end, it is worth it, and I could especially see this bra being magical for even bustier ladies out there! First I'll lay out some details about the bra and than the pros and cons, so if you're interested, enjoy the review! ABOUT THIS ITEM: (straight from the listing) - 91% Nylon, 9% Spandex - Imported - Hand wash and hang dry - Strapless bra with contoured cups featuring removable straps - Hook-and-eye closure at back - Cushioned lower bottom band for added comfort - Band and sides smooth and minimize bulge - Do not iron, Do not dry clean PROS: - Beautifully contours your breasts - Great coverage - Lower V point than expected so this bra works great with low cut dresses/shirts - Exceptional support - Insanely comfortable - Fit/Size was exactly as expected - Heavenly silicone lining and grippies all over the bra will ensure you can \"shake it, shake it, like you're supposed to do\" 🎵 because this bra isn't going to budge! (Seriously people, August wedding, insanely hot summer, pre wedding game, photos, ceremony, reception, definitely a little tipsy, dance floor for hours and stayed in place without having to adjust it until I took it off that night!!) CONS: - Pretty darn pricey! I purchased mine for $68 before tax - Shipping sucked. My bra was shipped in a plastic bag in a generic Amazon envelope and was definitely squished, bent and dented upon receiving it - NOT a push up (not necessarily a con but I was under the impression it would be). CONCLUSION: The under wire in this bra is extremely supportive and for you ladies who can't have any push up because their own boobs may suffocate them, this bra is pretty amazing and you should definitely give it a try! My sister and my two besties all range from DDD-G-F and I literally want to buy this bra for each of them because of the exceptional support and silicone grippies that this bra has. It's a beautiful, almost full coverage that looks flawless under clothes & dresses without having any overhang where bras tend to pinch up top when they're too small. It also has a beautiful shape and is low enough to wear with pretty low cut v shirts/dresses. The bridesmaid dress I wore it with had a very triangular top with low cleavage dip and spaghetti straps and I was very impressed with how well it worked! For any ladies who want more oomf, you could always add in some cup inserts to give you that push up feel too. Overall, this bra was definitely pricey and the shipping sucked which is why I rated it a 4/5 but the pros of this bra definitely outweighed the cons. Honestly the bra itself deserves a 5/5 rating. I would definitely recommend trying this bra, especially for the heavily blessed ladies! This bra is pretty magical 😍."

There is a thick rubber lining grip that helps, and the cup size for me was just right (32 C, which is my usual size). At first when I received the package I didn't expect the highest quality (it is a no frills bra), but once I tried it on I was impressed. I definitely recommend this bra."

Comparing the two, I have to notice that 34F is 3 cm smaller in the band than its ‘older sister’, and the center is ca 1 cm higher. I’ve founded it slightly snug but I am sure it will fit better over time. Cups provide a rounded, natural silhouette (no uniboob or torpedoes). No show lines under thinner top. It works for full bust. All in all I'm pleased."

I tried it on.... it FITS!!! Like other reviews have mentioned, the pads in the top are a little wonky. But I've got some larger ones that should work just fine. I'm not the most confident in this just because like I said, 3 kids, and general insecurities. My problem, not the suits. The bottoms just hit right where my belly fat is and it's just not what I consider the most flattering.... again, my own body issues and no fault of the suit. Typically I wear a medium in swim bottoms, 6 or 8 in universal thread jeans and a medium or large top. I'm 5'2, 140lbs and I wear a 32G/34DDD in bras. It's very comfortable, very well lined and so adorable!!"

Right now it's basically like sticking two pancakes in there and then tying it corset tight in hopes that there's no gaps for anyone to see, well, see nothing I suppose. Anyway after the first baby I was a 34B, I think I may be a bit smaller than that now, but my old bras do fit decently. I ordered a small and it fits perfectly. Even if you're a bit bigger or smaller than that, I think it would still fit nicely. I also bought plain black boyshort bikini bottoms to go with this top. They look so good together and I actually feel attractive with all my stretched out bits and scars tucked away. So order this, your sad deflated balloons will thank you later."

Its kinda nice because Im not worried about it moving when running etc. Like a lot of the other reviews, I removed the padding in the top because it didn’t look cute. The bottoms are pretty cheeky but still comfy. Seems like a good quality swim suit. I’m excited to wear it lots!"

      "text": "Let me start off by saying that I am 6'5, 255. I'm not ion the best shape of my life but I still have a worked out looking body. I've been searching for a while for a slim fit jogger set that actually fits me height and build correctly. And this set for the most part fit the bill. My reason for a 4-star rating is becuase of the lack of consistency amongst different colors. For ex, an XL in Blue may not fit the same as an XL in red. I ordeed a pair of joggers in Red, Green and White in XL and XXL. The XL was a little too tight. The XXL was perfect. At least I initially thought. That is until I got the Blue and Yellow pants in the XXL. Now these fit with perfection. They were slim, ankle taper was right. And they were everything I wanted in this type of style. So I order another set in another color in both XL and XXL. Now this time another type of fit. SMH. The XL fit like a tourniquet and the XXL, whjile a nice fit were not a well fit as my Blue and Yellow set. Yet both were different from my red set. There is NO consistency among sizes. Since Amazon allows free retunrs I would encourage those who are Prime customers take advantage of that priveledge and order two sizes to be on the safe side. Just return the one that doesn't fit. Other than that gripe fabric quality is good. The set is sewn very well (no loose or hanging threads). And I feel this is good quality for the price. Is it Nike/New Balance/Adidas quality? Naw. But it's still pretty good. I am happy. However I would have loved to have given this set 5 stars. But because of the inconsistency in sizing ,I am giving them 4-stars. In conclusion one thing for certain. Out of all the brands of Slim Fit Track set this brand most definitely fits the best. I plan on ordering a few more sets becuase not only are they comfortable but they are attention grabbers. If you have are in shape and have a nice lean muscular build you will turn heads."

I typically wear a medium, but after reading some other reviews, I ordered a medium and a large, and sure enough, the medium was way too small, but the large fit perfectly. Consequently, I suggest ordering one size up from your usual size. Other than that - a very nice looking and well made garment."

Finally after repeated cycles and loads of detergent and oxi clean, the white parts returned to white. One of the edge seams on the chest panels slightly loosened during this time as well but was easily stitched. Beautiful but took some time to be wearable. Also purchased the green and red one.

This ring is really lovely. And as I said I bought (1) in Silver, and (1) in Gold. However, after going back and checking how it is advertised, I found that it comes in a size 6 1/2.

In recovery, your foot tends to swell at times and these shoes adjust with the swelling and yet remain firm in place with or without swelling, so there is no increased risk of reinjury. Go crocs! Whoodathunk? Oh and they are pretty stylish to boot!"

But we were surprise the size was little big. So we had to place request for exchange. And Fortunately the size was too available. And finally we received the correct one. But still we have the question that why size is different to the piece in the official showroom, where she tried the sneaker physically.?

You simply have to tie ‘stopper’ knots (just like you would with the drawstring in your gym shorts) at the right spot to prevent the open ends from slipping through. That’s it. Prob not the best in an actual competition or race. Otherwise, they are wide and shiny. Many reviews mention color bleeding; my gold laces discolored themselves from one 4-hour car ride in the rear window. They still work of course. Better than any round lace."

      "text": "I bought this in a 2XL because of breast reduction surgery - I needed a band that wasn't tight. This is a very good bra: well-made, light, and molds to your breasts in terms of the cup. I still thought the 2XL was a little tight, so I ordered up to the 3XL. There's no difference in the band size! I compared the 2XL which I'd been wearing to the new, unworn 3XL and probably because I'd stretched it out wearing it, the smaller band size was actually longer. I'm hoping the 3XL at least stretches to the same length as as the 2XL. Pluses of this bra as compared to more expensive ones: 1. The straps are adjustable and thin (other bras of this type are a tank style with wide straps that don't adjust) 2. The band still rides up a bit (maybe it's just me and my menopausal bulges) but not nearly as much as others I've tried. 3. Really accomodates your shape, even though there appears to be little difference in the cup size from one size to the next. Minuses of this bra compared to others like it: 1. It's cut high under the arms to prevent bulges but chafes a bit there and shows if you wear a tank top with regular sized armholes. 2. The mark-up for pretty colors like blue and lavendar are extreme. This happens on a lot of sites, not just Amazon."

I was looking for Skechers because I know their yoga foam is super comfy, but really didn't like anything. In expanding my search on a different site I found these but not in my size. Came to Amazon, searched \"glitter flip flops\" and these came up not only in my size but $10 cheaper than the show site. I bought them in black and white and love both! The black isn't pure black but more like an iridescent multicolor glitter which I honestly love and the white is kind of the same just not as noticable. I took one start away because they're sightly uncomfortable around the toes but honestly I think I just need to break them in. The shoe itself, however, is very comfortable. I stood in them all day! I might buy more colors, 2 aren't enough 😂"

I put them on to wear to a fair and my husband said \"er... are you going to wear those?\" so, definitely not my best look LOL. Also, again, it might just be me, but the frames are a bit tight.

Put on an unpadded bra, grab your tape measure and let's find your bust and band sizes! Fit solutions for bra malfunctions Band Riding Up.If your brand doesn't sit just below your shoulder blades, try tightening the band or losening the straps. If that doesn't help, you need a smaller band. Band Digging In. If your band is digging into your ribs, chest or back, try loosening the band. If that doesn't fix it, you need to go up a band size or try a wider band. Straps Digging In. If your straps are digging in, try loosening them or switching to a bra with padded straps. If that doesn't help, your band – which should be doing most of the support work – is too big and it's time to downsize. Slipping Straps. If your straps are sliding around or off the shoulders, they might be stretched out (which happens over time). Or you might be in the wrong cup size causing the straps to sit too wide and slip more easily. Bulging Sides. If you're squeezing out the sides, your band is too small and confining your bust. Go up a band size or try a bra with more cup coverage. Overflowing Cups. If you're spilling out the side, top or bottom of your cups, it's time to trade up. Bigger cups will help keep your bust securely (and comfortably) contained. Gapping Cups. If your cups are gaping a lot or a little, try a smaller cup size so they sit flush with your skin. Dropping Bustline. If your bustline is pulling down, shorten your straps (but not so much they dig) and check your cups (there shouldn't be any gap if they're the right size). If you want even more lift, look to non-stretchy bras with firmer support and rigid straps. Poking Underwires. If your wire pokes, you might be in the wrong cup size. Too small can make the underwire too tight while too big can cause the wire to move around. Both lead to uncomfortable poking or prodding. ",

They have a good selection of colors, and at band size 50 it is unusual to find less than a D cup. 2 minor issues - There used to be a brand which had an “Almost B” size. That fit even better, ( A is too small.) and the other issue - the cups definitely separate boobs out to the sides. I didn’t notice it in past years, but after reading some reviews here about this, I see what they mean. Maybe manufacturing could bring the cups back toward forward a little? Thanks"

That said, the bra does create a lot of lift and also reduces the fullness of your \"measurement,\" so it is very good for fitting into otherwise too-tight tops and for layering. I'd probably have gone with a slightly larger size if I'd measured myself, but I also kind of like the fact that it reduces without feeling uncomfortable!"

Not too tight! Not too lose! Just right! Fits perfectly when using middle-placed hooks. Though a bit too pointy, (which I don't like), it makes my boobs feel a bit small and natural too so I like it still. I see myself wearing them even when I am one size smaller. Will definitely purchase these again soon! Thanks, Glamorise! :)"

      "text": "I had high hopes for this bra. The pictures of it looked good. So when I tried it on, it was very disappointing indeed. More than a bit baggy in the cup size, but I can accept that, as I’m usually a FF and had to get a G in this bra as no FF. But also, the ‘boob shape’ when it’s on, is not great - a bit pointy at the seam line, and due to absence of underwire, not really very containing, or at least, not in a rounded way, more of a lateral shape, squeezed out at the sides, so not flattering at all. However, the main reasons for giving this bra such a low rating are firstly, the material is coarse, scratchy, itchy, in the cups, back and straps - not at all comfortable to the skin - I wanted to take it off again, about 10 seconds after putting it on. And secondly, in my opinion it’s very overpriced (bras often are expensive, not sure why). But I am happy to spend a reasonable amount of money on a bra that fits well, supports well, is comfortable, and (bonus) even looks nice - quite hard to tick all those boxes when you’re a FF, but the bottom line has to be comfort - we have to wear these things, against our skin, all day! I would most definitely not recommend this bra."

The hood is really thick and warm which is a bit surprising since usually removable hoods arexkind of not that way. It’s slides on and off with ease and keeps me warm down to 20 below zero (so far) living in northern Minnesota. Maybe other people would like different colors so if different colors could be offered I’m sure this jacket would sell widely. Especially for the price. I took a chance buying this winter jacket and even though it was a gamble I won big time."

But overall pleased with the product I'm not very kind when it comes to disinfecting my earrings and let them sit in baths of alchol, peroxide, soap and water for half an hour, so the review about the rocks falling off after cleaning is not what I've experienced. I've only used two of this and haven't had any issues, except with the black one as the black starts to scratch a bit from taking off and on."

      "text": "My husband is really picky about his underwear. We live in South Florida and he insists on wearing T-shirts under all his shirts. Personally as a woman, I would never choose to live my life in Florida wearing 2 layers of clothing daily on my upper body because it's way too hot here for that, but my husband claims with the right T-Shirt on underneath his shirt, he feels cooler. There seems to be 2 major brands in men's underwear from what I've seen advertised around on the Internet and in the brick and mortar stores. I'm sure you know which ones I'm talking about. My husband had a \"been there, done that\" attitude about his old t-shirts and I had to start looking beyond those two brands. I found him some other less well known names and he always was unhappy with the way they felt or fit. Then GILDAN entered our lives and everything changed! I found the T-Shirts listed on Amazon and decided to buy them for him and give them a try. They are well packaged, bright white and neat looking. They are long and in proportion to his body. You would think I bought my husband a hot sports car with the way he reacts to these! He absolutely loves GILDAN because of the way they feel! No more complaining about the arms or neck being tight or the shirt popping out of his pants. These t-shirts fit the same and look the same as when they were brand new. No more shrinkage and when they come out of the dryer, they are in the exact shape they were in when they were brand new! And best of all, they keep him cool! We've found ourselves a winner, folks! Thanks GILDAN! Now my husband wants me to check if they are available in colors! Going to check on that right now!!"

Fits well. Not convinced enough yet to buy more, but I tend to be finicky that way. Need to see how well and long they wear. UPDATE Aug 2017 - After a few washings, I am not as sure as I was. The sleeves on each shirt has started to gather. Not a huge upset, but they are going to get signed for it. You get what you pay for."

      "text": "Amazon makes shopping so easy, simple and let's face it deliver to your place of preferred shipping makes shopping it really is a no brainer; especially with the price of gasoline these days. The only down side is when a vendor / supplier changes a product it, Amazon doesn't know. Clothes are almost impossible to buy on line with the exception of foundation items; (Socks, under garments and etc.) The original purchase has back in April of 2014...and they are still my go to pair of jeans for working around the house, the farm, wherever. Comfortable, nice medium denim weight and even with a few holes are sturdy enough to probably last another 3 -4 years. This is my third purchase of Wrangler Authentics Men's Classic 5-Pocket Cotton Relaxed Fit Jeans but will probably be my last. Like going to your favorite restaurant only to find they don't offer the \"exact same\" menu item, that is how I would describe this recent purchase of Wrangler jeans. Similar but not the same quality. These are made in Mexico, same product codes and etc. nothing has change but the jeans are definitely different. The first thing I noticed was how soft the denim was. It was like a bath towel. The fabric used to make the pockets are so thin, that you can almost see right through them.. The blue dye on the demin bled even after being set with my mothers patented reminder to always set clothes with salt water. Did I mention they were soft? I mean baby butt soft, you will look down just to make sure you have pants on. That is all well and good unless your wanting to purchase these to use besides lounging around the house. They are comfortable. While I am enjoying the fit, and feel of these jeans, I'm suspect they will are not going to last 8 years like their predecessors. In the past, these have been great inexpensive jeans very good value. Are they worth the purchase? if your looking for pair of jeans you can do some yard work and household chores and still hold up, I would say definitely consider other options. If your looking for a comfortable pair of Wranglers for casual wear, you might enjoy these. Just don't expect them to ever make as infamous as ZZ Top's Blue Jean Blues."

But this is probably my fault that I did not hit the right size, no complaints for the jeans. Also , and this is a reason for 4 stars, one of the belt side holders detached , needed to go to sewer to connect it back, I think that it was badly sewed in the first place. But what is important to me that the fabric is exactly what I was looking, not too thin and not too thick . I am from warm country (Israel) , and too thick fabric just cant be weared, and too thin will not hold well. So from this regard it is just perfect"

      "date": "Reviewed in the United Kingdom on November 11, 2019",
      "text": "I lived in the US for over twenty years. The last five or so, I started buying Wranglers over Levi's as they were good value for money and made just as well. There are Wranglers with a \"traditional\" W sewing on the back pockets - heavier duty and meant for cowboy folk riding horses and doing country line dancin' (i.e. looking the part an' probably wearin' a shirt with pearlized buttons). If you're looking for W pockets, these ain't them. Search for \"Wrangler cowboy\" instead. These jeans are often considered \"business casual\" attire and have either a line or no trim at all on the pockets. I've bought these \"authentic\" ones with different sewn on labels at the back, some have a red Wrangler tag on them too, while others don't. Some are made in Mexico while others are made in Nicaragua. None are made in America, but the cotton material is American. They all wear and last exactly the same way. In America, these are the jeans you'd find at stores such as Target (nearest local equivalent would be a large Tesco store), as opposed to the higher priced shopping mall fashion stores. The waist sizing is typical for American jeans - it is NOT usually accurate to your waist measurements. I wear 33\" jeans - and my waist size is 37\" - take that as a hint, it's typically off by 2\" to 4\". If you've never worn American jeans before, I'd suggest visiting a store that sells them such as a Levi's store, and trying on a few pairs to figure out what your American jeans size is. These are not \"flex\" material. Wrangler Flex jeans have more give at the waist. The inside length is usually reasonably accurate, with a tolerance of an inch., unless I'm shrinking. They're still best worn with boots or a decent pair of shoes. So to put anyone's mind to rest, these are actual Wranglers, meant for everyday comfortable work wear. They should last at least a few years - certainly more than double the time compared to any of the jeans I've bought from the UK stores - because the fabric is a noticeably higher quality. After finding these on Amazon, I bought two pairs and they fit like my old ones, and the price isn't much more than it costs to buy in the States (full disclosure, many states don't charge tax on clothes - I've bought these in Montana for nine bucks a pair, and fifteen bucks in Minnesota)."

I guess it's alright if your legs are like giant redwood, but for me there was just too much material. Overall, I was pleased surprised at the quality of these jeans especially as they are direct US imports and the most important thing, the really competitive price! Whilst I put this down as a learning experience, and returning through a UPS Shop was a hassle, I am hanging in there and have reordered the same size Wrangler imports in a 'Regular' cut. Haven't received them yet, but fingers crossed they'll be okay? Would definitely recommend, but think about your body shape and what you want before ordering? 3* only because of the misleading photos, description and hassle returning. Quality 5*. Value 5*."

There are some differences between the UK/USA design but nothing noticeable and they are extremely comfortable, they are thick but feel soft. The price is an absolute bargain, you can't go wrong with them, if you like Jeans, you should by them because i doubt you could find anything as cheap as these for the quality you get."

      "text": "I love this pendant. It's simple yet beautiful, and priced right at $20. The size (for me) is perfect. Some Pros: 1. Pendant. 2. Price. 3. Length of chain. Some Cons: 1. White Gold Plating - Pendant's reverse side plating will wear away quickly. 2. The Chain - Chain will turn your neck green. 3. Price of rechaining can be very expensive. I was able to get the pendant rechained for $20, bringing the total cost to $40+ tax. The new chain stayed on the pendant for 2 weeks of continuous use, before the chain came off. I was warned that may happen, but the alternative was to get the chain laser-welded, for $100+. Read the specifications, read the reviews. I am glad I ordered this item. It has been a good learning experience. I enjoy the pendant and .925 sterling silver replacement chain. The wearing-off of the reverse-side plating doesn't bother me, and the pendant is dainty and beautiful; simple. --I do wish the replacement chain was laser-welded for durability; but at that price, this would turn a $20/$40 gift into a $150 gift with an inexpensive, worn backside, pendant. I do wish the item came with a beautiful sterling silver chain, as advertised; even as an optional upgrade. If so, i would purchase this item again, for $35-45. As is, I would recommend to use your own discretion, and would generally advise staying away, and finding something with a real .925 silver chain, that doesn't turn your neck green. I have now had this item for 4 1/2 months."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 10, 2016",
      "text": "BLUF: They are warm as heck. Order a size or two up on the waist. Try them on at a store if you can. I’ve just gotten back to riding my motorcycle again year-round again. I’ve been adding layers and clothing along the way to ensure that I can ride throughout the winter, and this past week the temps and wind chill took the ‘feels-like’ temperature down to 20 degrees. I really hate wearing thermals, so I decided to try coveralls at a friend’s urging. After having spent a morning looking over different styles on the internet, I determined that a quilt-lined pair of overalls is what I wanted to go with. I took a trip over to my local Tractor Supply Company who had this same brand priced at exactly $20 more. I would have bought a pair then, but they didn’t have the size that I wanted. They also didn’t have my size in their store-brand either. I assume that had something to do with going after the first major cold/freezing spell. So, the biggest benefit was actually trying them on. In reality I wear a 32” waist. When I tried on a 34” waist in the store, I thought it was a bit tight. I ended up ordering a 36” waist from Amazon, and so far, they are perfect. I don’t feel like it’s snug. I ordered roughly two sizes up and have been very happy with the result. The length is 30”, just like every other pair of pants I own. Notes on fit: -I wear them with a pair of combat boots. It’s easier getting them on than getting them off. -The zipper on the pant legs works fine. The buttons are a pain in the rear, but that might be because they are new -and very stiff. -There are so many pockets. Great for using them for their intended purpose – overkill for riding -I don’t like the fasteners for the overall straps. They work fine, but buttons would have been easier here. This is more like a hook and loop style. -I had to take off the overalls to adjust the straps. I ordered my normal ant inseam, but had to tighten the straps quite a bit. Still would not have changed that decision. When the temps are well below 40, and half that with the wind chill, these work amazingly well. My mid-section and upper legs are toasty warm all the way down to 20 degrees real-feel, and going 60 mph. The only drawback that I found when using them for this purpose, it gets cold from about my shins down when the cold air gets up under the pant legs. This is due to them being loose at the bottom of the legs. Again – I am not necessarily using them for their intended application, so it’s not surprising that they are loose and allow air to flow, but that’s the only drawback. Otherwise, these fit great and they keep me warm. If I only had a pair of gloves this warm."

I wear a 36×30 jeans so I bought a 40x30 and they are still pretty tight with any kind of pants on underneath. The only way these fit is if I only wear a pair of underwear or just a single layer of thermals underneath. I wish I would have gone like 6 sizes bigger instead of 4 sizes bigger like I did. I'm most likely going to be returning these depending on if they keep me warm enough with just a single pair of thermals under them. If I need any extra layers under these to stay warm they will be worthless to me. But they do have a pretty darn nice layer built in so we will see. I'll try to update once I get to use them for the first time out in the -6° weather I will be facing next week. I work outside every day in freezing ass cold weather. 🥶 So I will put these babies to the ultimate test."

They keep me nice and toasty in the nasty cold of eastern Ontario where I’m up and in the barn before dawn. Tested them in minus 30C and so far they work like a charm. I’ve gotten the outer layer soaked carrying water to paddocks and not felt a bit of damp. The clasps are a bit challenging when you are in a rush to take them off but you will never have to worry about them springing loose on you. The multiple pockets make storing tools a breeze and the chest pocket is big enough for an iPhone X in a heavy case, so that’s super handy if you always have to have a cell or walkie on you when working."

If possible turn the jacket inside out. Read more Set the Cycle Set the washing machine to a cold wash on a delicate or wool cycle (or the equivalent gentle setting). Read more Dry the Jacket Padded jackets should not be air dried, it would be best to tumble dry at a low heat. Don’t be tempted to set the dryer to a high heat as you risk melting the seams. Remember to always check the label of your garment for exact care details. Read more ",

We got it for a climate where it usually bottoms out in the forties Fahrenheit and I think it will work well for that. Now granted we haven’t actually used them yet, and my review is based on examination of the jacket and comparison with our other jackets. I buy a size ahead in the off season so that it will fit then the next year."

Fits perfectly with room to grow! This coat isn’t as thick as I expected, but it’s warm enough for TEXAS on most cold days, but wouldn’t expect it to be warm enough for snow environments though. We Texans are a bit wimpy in really cold weather! Lol! It is not water resistant as stated in details. Great for average cold/dry days."

It is also fairly waterproof- the water collects and beads nicely on the surface. It might not hold out in a full out down pour but definitely sufficient for most rain or snow. I haven't seen this type of quality in a while! I ordered one size up to get the correct fit which was slightly big but will get the most wear from the coat."

      "text": "Well, my son has been using this coat for about two months. It’s not even used daily because it’s been unseasonably warm. The zipper is really impossible. It’s hard to get in, hard to zip, and it catches the fabric. My son end up not shipping his coat at school because he can’t get adult help - - and frankly, he shouldn’t need help zipping his coat. He’s in 4th grade! But it’s really hard to zip. Additionally, equally unacceptable if not more.the thread/stitching is coming out in one of the panels causing one “big” panel in the middle. Awful quality. We bought this exact coat a few years ago and my son lost it on the playground and was heartbroken. I thought I’d make him happy and buy him the exact same coat a size larger to replace the lost one. Very dissatisfied. Do yourself a favor and spend half the money on a higher quality coat. I’m disgusted."

Except, the first time my daughter wore it, she put £40 in the inside pocket with her Oyster card - only when she got to the bus stop did she realise that the inside pocket has a big hole in it and she had lost her £40 and her Oyster card. On further inspection, both the inside pockets are not fully sewn up - so pointless as you could lose anything you put in them. I'm interested to know why internal pockets would have holes in them and what the manufacturers response to this situation is - my daughter (12) was distraught and so was I. Mountain Warehouse come on - fix this please."

      "text": "Comfortably fits my average build 7 year old daughter (1m40 tall) with a little room for growth. It's kept her warm enough in the recent cold spell, but my son has an identical coat in a different colour and he needed additional layers. Finish is just ok, with lots of loose threads and the stitching came undone on the inside of the cuff on the second wear. I've patched it up as she loves the colour, but it's not a great start. The zip doesn't catch the liner unlike a lot of similar style coats. Buy slightly bigger than you need if intending to use in winter to allow for layering. Keep in mind it's not waterproof either, but a brief light shower won't seep through the seams. They pack down small if carrying in a rucksack, but no stuff sack provided. If we get a few months of wear out of it, I'd buy another. If this review was useful, I'd be grateful if you click 'Helpful'. Thank you"

He had one like this of a different brand, except it wasn't waterproof or as good quality, he wouldn't take it off and it became far too small. So I let him pick the colour of this one and he hasn't stop wearing it since it arrived. We got caught in a huge downpour and I expected him to be soaked through when we got home....but he was completely dry under the jacket, I was actually impressed....I expected it to come through the stitched seams. The coat is smaller than I thought it would come up. I got a 3-4 as usually this is huge on my 3 year old but the coat fits perfect it's more on the size of age 3 not 4. However I'd buy again. It's a great little jacket. My son's been wearing with a jumper and t shirt underneath in the current cold weather and he says he's warm, even though I wonder as it's so thin, but he doesn't act or seem cold after long periods of time out in it. I might get him some more colour as he chose red, so hard to match alot of clothing, but it's a lovely post box red and he absolutely loves it which is great as I no longer have to fight him to put on a coat."

Bought the jacket for next season thinking it will be a but big, but she is wearing it now already. I'd say they come a bit small. As my 8y.o. son is wearing his 9-10y. petrol (colour) jacket (bought it as next size up, but he wears it already) and he is not big boy, he is 129cm, but just about 21kg. And have one for myself. I think the purple one looks a bit brighter in the picture than in reality. Keeps us warm in spring, not sure how warm it will be in Irish winter or -30 degrees as in description. Jacket is very lightweight. If it keeps us warm in winter I might have found our favourite jacket."

      "text": "The dress fits as I expected and is very flattering, but the material feels rough at first and the zipper sticks. I couldn’t zip it up when I had it on, so I had to zip it then pull it over my head to put on the dress. It looks much nicer than the actual quality. I’m hoping the material will soften after washing but it feels okay after I‘ve had it on for a while. The dress didn’t have many noticeable wrinkles out of the bag so I think it will make a good travel dress. I don’t have much faith in the durability, but it could surprise me. I think it is a good option for people who are trying to find a cheap dress that packs well and actually has a shape unlike a lot of the t-shirt dresses I see out there. I especially like how the bodice fits around my chest, and the pleats are very cute. I’m happy with the length, too. I’ll probably buy another one! TLDR: There are flaws in the quality of the material and zipper, but it looks great! Very nice design."

She also told me she love the look and feel of the dress. I will be ordering this again only hope that they put the elastic waistband on the rest of the dresses. This dress style will not disappoint."

      "text": "I now have two of these dresses and plan to get more. I have the Red- which is navy with bright red flowers all over, and the Beige- which is white with burgandy and dark pink flowers. I love them both. They fit well and are super flattering. They hug the waist but then fall from there so it hides any tummy bulge. You will need a slip if you get one of the dresses with a white or light colored background, because they're see through. I love the fit, the classy look, the weight and feel of the fabric, the pockets, the neckline, and the length. The chest and sleeves aren't tight and the dress falls just below my knee caps. For refrence I am about 5'9-5'10, 180 lbs. Small C cup. Small waist, big hips. I usually wear a 12-14 in dresses depending on the cut. I like dresses that I feel are classic and that I DO NOT need to wear shapewear with and these dresses fit the bill perfectly. I would highly recommend these dresses."

The material was actually nice and soft, not too thin (unlike most dresses from Amazon). The flower pattern (3188zs) was just a little too large for my taste and I was wanting to wear it to an evening wedding and it just didn't seem dressy enough for that due to the print. However I would consider reordering in a different, smaller print for a less dressy occasion."

I have owned many nice watches and could not afford another one in this rotten economy with 9k watches going for 15,000. It looks good but does lack a WOW factor, its face is darker than it looks on the website and the bezel feels cheap when you wind it. The visual of the movement through the back is underwhelming. Overall for $650 it is a nice watch. Definitely no regrets with this one."

The strap, especially the closure is of lesser quality. I was able to remove the closure and replace with a regular buckle and will use as an alternate. The only downside is that the blue bezel does not match the dial. I would think it easy to get a perfect match. Still the bezel is an upgrade over the black shiny one on the earlier model. Also, Caliper CO7.811 is an upgrade over the standard Tissot CO7.111 in other models."

Very Good quality but they don’t stretch very much and I don’t like to have to tug them on. Got mediums from an actual store and so knew to get large from Amazon and I don’t have to tug and jump to pull them on! They are warm, for winter weather, with light fleece fuzz inside, and good windbreak/thicker legging material on the outside. Length was fine in either medium or large, no leg gap. Such a deal compared with athletic brand names winter wear. Used for walking and running and even for work."

As a result the hat's straw weave was completely broken in two areas on the hat; the shipping method also warped the brim of the hat and caused minor damage to at least three other spots on the brim. My crown is 23 inches round. The large size of this hat seems quite comfortable on the head. Furthermore the fitted internal band and the drawstring are soft.

The chinstrap helps hold the hat in place because it can easily catch a bit of wind. This is a woven straw hat so by its nature it is somewhat delicate. I use it for pretty relaxed activity but if you were tossing it around and packing it into bags I think it could break. It is also a very large brim so I it can catch on things haha. For my purposes the hat is perfect but I would not recommend it for more intense activity. If you found this review helpful please click the button below."

The request was for a ribbed tank, which would have had more of a knit like feel so that when it gathered up, it smooths out and bounces back better. However, this dress is workable, just consider what a ribbed tank is suppose to look like and see why it is preferred."

      "text": "This dress is OK but it feels really cheap like something you could pick up at forever 21 for half the price. I was disappointed in the fabric as I thought it would be thinner, stretchier and softer but it’s actually a medium thick ribbed fabric that is not soft and doesn’t offer a lot of stretch. The dress is also way shorter than pictured on the model and I am only 5’5. The fit overall is true to size. I’m 34C/D usually take a 27/4 in pants and dresses in small or medium depending on brand and fabric. I’m currently pregnant and based on other reviews I got the small but I wish I had ordered medium as maybe it would be a bit longer! The dress does fit me and my little bump for now as I get bigger I think this will be way too short to wear as a dress! I ordered in black and grey and grey is a little longer but is also shorter than pictured and the fabric doesn’t have much give."

Rope Rope chains are linked in a twisted pattern to resemble a genuine rope. Rope chains come in both delicate versions where they are a popular choice for pendant necklaces, and heavier versions where the chain itself is the main attraction. Cable Cable chain, also known as link chain, consists of a series of identical oval links that are interconnected to form a functional and beautiful chain. Rolo Rolo chains are composed of oval interlocking links with alternate links turned 180°. This chain comes in different widths; smaller chains being more popular with females and larger, chunkier chains with males. Read more Figaro The figaro chain has flattened links which vary in size. It usually has 2 or 3 shorter links alternating with a longer link. Mariner Mariner chain connects a small, round link with a larger oval link. These links resemble the chain attached to an anchor on a boat. Curb The curb is a simple and classic design of flat, interlocking, identical links. Smaller curb chains work well with pendants and diamond cut or twisted curb chains tend to reflect the most light.

The hat was not folded in the box so it was not bent and there were no creases. It sits perfectly on my head and there is a drawstring on the inside for adjustments, if you need to. I did have the opportunity to wear it outside in the sun. The brim is wide enough to protect most of my face from the sun and all of the back of my neck. I have long hair and I wear it in a ponytail to one side of my face. I find that this keeps my neck cooler. I am a 56 years old woman and need to protect myself from the sun. The hat goes great with a denim skirt, tee, and short kimono. It also looks great with jeans. I bought this hat for $13.99 and it was worth it. So, ladies (or gentlemen) buy this!"

I picked the lake blue, which made me look only slightly like Mario as long as I steered away from a red shirt underneath! lol The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I didn't love the straps. The straps loop through the hole and then you have to tie them, which isn't convenient if you have to suddenly go to the bathroom (women over a certain age know what I'm talking about).

It’s a shame that all the work that’s been put into them was wasted because they used the cheapest material possible. I wore the pants for an hour and although the pants are loose, they already have stretched out knees because the fabric is so thin. Also, it’s okay not to have buttons, but the button holes aren’t supported at all with any interfacing, which allow the holes to stretch and rip easily. I bought these for a costume so they were okay for a Halloween party. If they were of better quality, I would actually wear them!"

For context, I have maybe taken this necklace off a grand total of 5 times in the past 4 months (one being to take photos of it for this review) and I have put it through a wringer - pools, showers, scuba diving (the OCEAN?!), camping/backpacking, and much much more, yet this little thing has held up like a champ! Right now it looks exactly like it did when I received it back in June. Maybe my only grievances are micro scratches on the back, but honestly I was expecting a lot worse for wear by now. Safe to say I'm very happy with this piece and highly recommended :-) Tbh, I felt a bit guilty for not writing a review sooner for how outstanding the quality of this necklace has been."

A lot of reviews mention how soft the material is and how it’s compatible to lululemon which is not the case at all. The material feels very cheap, the top of the shirt looks like it’s stretched out and the padding feels like styrofoam. I would return this if I can and might even cancel the second order I placed of another colour I purchased."

Its obviously not going to be a high impact support bra for me, but I've had no issues with any of the workouts I've done in it so far.

      "text": "I don't like to size up or down in shoes too often. If they don't fit, they don't fit a d I just look for anotherbbrand or style. It just seems that when I change sizes for length, other parts of the shoe are wrong then for me (like the width or vamp or something.) But I was really in need of a pair of ballet flats in leather. These are surprisingly hard to find. I don't want heels, I don't want embellishments, just simple, black, leather flats. I don't really like the ones with elastic as they often will pull and annoy my Achilles tendon in the back, or the toes will look curled up like an elf. But I got these. They aren't to curled up, but we're slightly short. I have a foot that fits well in pointy toe shoes, so these round ones bumped my second toe in my regular size. And the elastic didn't help. So, I went up from 9.5 to 10. I think I really would have needed a 9.75 as the 10 is just a touch too long and can slip on ff of my heel. But there is no discomfort so I kept them. If you are on the small side of a size or have a ballet dancer type toe alignment, you should be ok. If you are right on or bigger in your size, you may want to go up a half size. Look for \"free returns\" when you pick your size (not all third party sellers have free returns) or get them on prime wardrobe (that's what I did) to ensure you get the right size. They are really cute and I wear them very often!!!"

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 31, 2015",
      "text": "I've been putting off writing this review because I feel ambivalent about these shoes. I have two pairs of Lucky Brand Emmie ballet flats in size 6.5W, the black and the nude. Let me start with the good points of these shoes - the leather is really soft, and they have very nice, basic, uncomplicated styling, which I like. The nude were good for the summer, although they were a little darker in person than I expected. The insole has some padding, and I did not find them to be hot or sweat-inducing. I wore them barefoot or with liners in the summer - though the liners tended to show - and wear them with trouser socks or tights now. They fit fine either way. They are very light, so carrying them to change into during snow boot weather will be easy. I've worn the nude ones occasionally, and the black ones several times a week since July and the soles and heels seem to be wearing well. The soles are not slippery. I used waterproofing spray and they will tolerate light rain, though I probably would not wear them in a downpour. I had a hard time deciding what size to get. My regular size for dress shoes is 6.5M, 7 for athletic shoes and boots, and my foot is wider in the front with a narrow heel. I thought I might need the extra width in the front, so I went with 6.5W. The length is snug (i.e. without extra length, like you would wear an actual ballet shoe) but OK - I think the 7 would have been too long. I also think the M would have been too narrow in the front. However, there is a lot of extra leather around the heel. Because of the elasticized topline, the heel does not slide around or cause blisters, which often happens when I wear flats, it just doesn't look great. [Note that since writing this review, I had occasion to try on the 7M in a store, and it was too long and a bit narrow in the front, though the heel fit better. Because of the elasticized topline, the 7M actually turned up a bit in the front where there was extra room, whereas my shoes in the 6.5W do not. I believe that especially for this shoe, where the leather is soft and will stretch and the elastic will hold the shoe to your foot, a snugger fit, with less than the usual thumb's width gap in the front, is better.] The other issue is comfort. If you are the kind of person who can wear ballet flats comfortably, I expect you will find these very comfortable. Although they do not have any kind of arch support, the padding in the insole makes them better than many other ballet flats. However, I am not that kind of person. I have lowish arches and a tendency to plantar fasciitis and thus to heel pain. I knew I was asking for trouble with ballet flats, but I really like their versatility, so I started out prepared to make whatever adjustments were necessary. Initially, I wore them with the little silicone arch supports they make for flats, which I had from my last (even less comfortable) pair of flats, but I would have heel pain. I tried them with the silicone gel inserts they make for flats, and the heel pain was better, but I had arch pain. So I tried putting the arch supports on top of the inserts, and that's not bad - the extra width accommodates the combination, and while they make my feet look wider, I can now wear them all day, including light to moderate walking, without pain. Because I needed a solution right away, I went with drug-store available options, but there are probably better accessories out there, albeit for more money. I got these shoes for quite a good price, so I did not mind the additional cost of the inserts, but I'm not sure I would have wanted to pay for the shoes and better inserts, or for the shoes at full price, knowing I would need to pay for inserts also. In summary, these are nice looking and nicely made ballet flats. I did not size up in length, as many recommend, but you may want to if you want a roomier shoe and are not comfortable with a snug fit. You may want to get the wider width if your foot is wider in the front, but be aware that the heel is also wider. This is a typical ballet flat, which is not a terribly supportive shoe. If you have problem feet, these will not be comfortable for you without some kind of insert, but may be wearable with inserts. I can't say that I love the way the way these shoes feel or look on my feet (although I really wanted to), but I do wear them regularly and they do the job. If someone invents ballet flats that have great arch support and cushioning, simple lines, are made with real leather, don't cause blisters, and don't cost a fortune, I will buy them. Until then, my Lucky Brand Emmies will do."

The first time I wore them the elastic felt tight, and where it rubbed was quite sore. I didn’t wear them for a few days, and the next time I put them on they didn’t hurt at all! So if they feel snug at the back just wear them around the house and give them a bit of time to break in."

I needed something with a soft memory foam! I ordered these and they lasted a good year. ( the memory foam will eventually wear off tho) but I don’t think it’s their fault, it’s just I over wore mine because they were super comfy. I have ordered other slippers from Amazon, and they were all terrible! Fur would come off everywhere or the memory foam was way to hard and not comfy’!

These Costas with full coverage lenses in a teacup shape will bring that warmth to everyone you meet back in your world.

My first pair has gotten dropped so often and scratched on the lenses, it was difficult to see with any clarity. My primary purpose for the initial purpose was wearing these for driving. I am very sensitive to bright light and glare, and these glasses have made it possible for me to feel more confident driving at timers of day when the glare is focused at my eye level. They are lightweight, well made, and the tint makes everything look like you are seeing life through the proverbial rose colored lenses. I should add that in between my first and second purchase of this pair of glasses, I tried about a dozen other Costa styles, but came back to this, and glad I did."

That a big reason I use Amazon for many purchases. After returning those, I searched for another seller on Amazon and found Jomashop!! I am 100% satisfied with my purchase from Jomashop.

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2022",
      "text": "I am a Mom of two boys, 3.5 years apart. One is now 12 years old in a man’s size 10W and the youngest is 9 in a youth size 3W. I have purchased two pairs of these in brown and black since my oldest started school in 2014, starting at about size 1 youth. More often than not I am able to save the older son’s outgrown Jungle Mocs for my younger son. We have only had to replace a few pairs of the lighter tan colors, as they do tend to show stains more. The black are generally passed on to the youngest still looking brand new. I have even gotten away with hand washing them in the sink and air drying them with paper towels stuffed in them to ensure they keep their shape on the rare chance they can’t resist a mud puddle. I am amazed at some of the bad reviews these get, because these shoes hold up for multiple boys with some very basic care. First, always waterproof any suede footwear with 2-3 coats of Camp Dry spray before you let your young man wear them. Do that 2-3 times a year. A suede brush and a damp washcloth goes a long way at keeping daily dirt and grime off. Teach your little men to not drag their toes to stop while riding a scooter, bike, swinging on a swing, etc…point out how that habit destroys even the most sturdy shoes. Inspect their shoes often and snip or burn off any loose threads before your sweet boy can’t resist tugging on one while trying to sit still in class. Always purchase at least two pairs of shoes for your kiddos; it’s not healthy for their feet, or the longevity of their shoe, to wear the same pair everyday. Feet sweat a lot, and a shoe will last longer if you rotate between two pairs, and allow one to dry out for 24 hours. Always wear socks and a shot of Lysol weekly keeps them sanitary and stink free. Purchase a shoe sizer and make sure you are buying the right size and width; try to resist buying big for grow room. These Jungle Mocs have outlasted my two very active boys and been passed on to younger cousins with this basic care. These are truly bullet proof boys school shoes for us, and we haven’t had a P.E. teacher complain yet, that they aren’t supportive enough for running and exercising."

The length falls 6” below my waist, and the sleeves run a little past my wrists. My stomach is flat. Knowing all that, size Large fits like a glove. The sweater looks a little fragile. I have to be careful how I take it off because I know I will get a hole in it. I don’t think I will be able to throw it in the washer and dryer. If you like military clothes and you’re a slim or muscular guy, definitely buy one of these. Feels and looks great. Good luck out there."

      "text": "I really like these retro-style military type sweaters, and I own three of them (an RAF and two Royal Marine sweaters). I have had them for months or years, without any problems. I purchased the sweater in the photo from Captain Dave just before Christmas. I got it in a large, the same as the other sweaters I wear. The first time I wore this sweater, it tore, as you can see in the photo. The hole on the right was immediately noticeable; the smaller tear I saw soon after. I asked about returning the sweater for a refund, but Captain Dave's return policy is that the buyer has to cover the cost of return shipping. Having been accustomed to, and spoiled by, Amazon's return policy, I was frustrated that Captain Dave would not cover the return cost. I am out almost $53 for a cheaply made sweater, and I have to pay to get a refund? How is that in any sense fair or just? It isn't. Sadly, in this case, the Amazon A-Z Marketplace refund policies does not apply; I had several emails with Amazon, as well as chats. I guess Captain Dave has its own alphabet, possibly spelled RIP-OFF or CHEAP, that is outside the A-Z of Amazon. If you choose to buy from Captain Dave, know that you take a risk. I have a sweater that I am too embarrassed to wear or even give away to a thrift store."

It is no joke when I say follow the reviews as far as sizing or you'll be sending it back. I would have given 5 stars but the finish work on the seams at the end of the sleeves and bottom of sweater were not great. I had to over sew them to prevent unraveling.

Still, they are light-weight, flexible, well ventilated, and easy to pack. I was disappointed when my new set did not arrive with a stuff bag. But that is my only complaint. These are good for light to moderate rain conditions and relatively short exposures (1- 2 hrs). It's hard to get better protection with light-weight materials. Still these are my favorite light-weight rain gear. Give them a try."

      "text": "Make sure you order these on AMAZON or AMAZON prime in case you need a exchange. This set of rain gear I purchased through Amazon Prime and this dealer sent the correct set and size A+ please read below if in case your thinking of ordering from frogg toggs direct web site.. Warning : if you order these DO NOT get them through the original froggtoggs site their customer service is absolutely horrible!!! I been calling for days and no reply just to ask if I can exchange on a previous order the set I bought before this set of rain gear, they answer the phone, but the woman who does returns Never returns a email or phone call and I left over 14 calls to the place along with numerous emails just asking if I can exchange them, because they do not return your money under no circumstances at all that is listed on their site. So a word to the wise buy from Amazon PRIME at least you can return them or get them from a stone and mortar dealer that you can try on the stuff.. or you will be out 95 dollars and have rain gear to fit a giant. even if I was 6'4 the pants would have been too big!! Update: on 6/17/13 I finally got a live person to help since the person dealing with returns never answers the phone or returns calls or emails. Anyway I ended up getting a return number. I tracked the return and it was accepted by frogg toggs AKA Guntersville breathables and item was signed for. Today is 6/24/13 I called to get a status update and no luck with some one to help you there. The operator is nice, but it's too bad she can not connect me with a live person again customer service is horrible.. As for now Guntersville breathables DBA frogg toggs has my money and the product and no customer service what so ever.. I will call back and try again. I will update again when I hear something. UPDATE: on 6/24/13 I called Guntersville breathables DBA frogg toggs, and spoke with (Tina) the operator who then connected me to a Girl Named (Ashley) who told me their is a woman named (Judy) who was not available at the time or not there today.. Judy who does the returns in the order they are received and will take 3 weeks or more to process the return. also this Returns rep Judy is the only ONE that handles returns. I was informed there was nothing more I can do to make this go faster. So a warning to the people who order from the frogg toggs web site beware if you need a exchange... basically I will have no rain gear this summer for my weeks of traveling. Also if you try to email them you get a failure delivery repeatedly, I guess this is a small operation being only one person handling returns I see now this is going to be a long dragged out process.. so Like I said if you think you might need customer service I'd pay the extra at a brick and mortar store or AMAZON Prime because by the time you pay the return shipping your over what you would pay at the store, and the store will provide you with some level of customer service. bottom line order these from AMAZON PRIME they atleast will make things right if you have a problem. Update 7/19/2013 Had to call frogg toggs back said my jacket was on back order and Should be here at the end of August 2013 and the tek toad pants would be here in September sometime. Hopefully at this point a refund would have been better especially when frogg toggs never sent me notice of any back order. Just plain ole bad service and operations will not ever repeat business with them or their product again. Update: 7/29/13 I was contacted by a woman named Misty on 7/29/13 Misty was very pleasant to speak with and very professional. Misty offered to send out a upgraded rain suit on 7/30/13 for me to look at and see if I liked it. She also said she would email me with a tracking number and then I would have her contact information also. as of 8/2/13 still no email and yes I checked my email spam folder nothing there either, so I guess I'm back to square one at this point very frustrated. Update: after months of dealing with froggtoggs directly still no customer service at all.. no one returns calls.. they did end up sending me a totally different gear than I ordered, I guess I'm stuck with this unwanted gear(garage sale)trust me DO NOT buy directly from Froggtoggs.com if they don't have it in stock you will end up getting whatever they send you,and this is acceptable by the BBB because I got stuck with it, so make sure you read terms or description for returns. I never had problems using amazon prime. Amazon always has a good contact number or email that's not bogus, unlike frogg toggs.. Although I had a really bad experience with ordering from Frogg Toggs.com I hope to save someone else from being stuck with leftovers they want to send you and keep $$$. you should get what you order on that note I was scammed out of a little more than 90 US dollars.. Froggtoggs customer service did lie to the BBB about contacting me if she contacted me id have the emails and she never called or attempted to email me Misty William in customer service you lied.."

      "text": "If you're after a luxurious fashionable coat, this isn't it. If you wan't a cheap, well cut and sensibly designed shell to keep the rain off then I'd strongly recommend it. It will keep you dry and crucially it will work with anything from a T Shirt to thick down jacket underneath. You put this on when it rains and take it off when it stops. I'm not sure how breathable it really is but breathability in general is vastly overrated for rainwear. It does NOT have pockets but this is a shell. A refreshingly good product from a company thats not built on hype."

But there were some strings I had to cut. I purchased a medium and it was too big in the chest for me (I’m small chested). Normally I would get a size small but took a risk with the medium to give myself extra breathing room. I probably should have purchased the small. The dress gave me plenty of breathing room and I altered it in the chest area to fit me better."

      "text": "My kid's little league team is the Miami Hurricanes this season, so I bought this NCAA Miami Hurricanes Women's Distressed School Arch Heathered Grand Slam Tee, Large, Charcoal HTR along with 2 other add-on items around the same price range ( each less than $10).: Alta Gracia NCAA Miami Hurricanes Women's Short Sleeve Spun Scoop Tee, Green, Large & NCAA Miami Hurricanes Women's Double Pattern Scroll Favorite Short sleeve T-Shirt, X-Large,Kelly I read several reviews before purchasing, and was well aware that this shirt runs small, so I ordered a large. I'm a 5ft tall, and 142lbs, nursing mom, and typically wear a size medium. The large fit well, and of the three shirts I purchased, this was by FAR my favorite. The V-shaped neckline was perfect, especially as a nursing mom. The fabric is a nice soft distressed cotton blend, which I found to be the coolest option. I also noticed that the distressed fabric is also slightly see through when you hold the shirt up to a lamp, but that was not an issue while wearing the shirt. This shirt also has the most comfortable stretch to it out of the three that I purchased. Of the other shirts ( all of which, also ran small): NCAA Miami Hurricanes Women's Double Pattern Scroll Favorite Short sleeve T-Shirt, X-Large,Kelly has a crew neck, and was a lighter/brighter green, but felt longer than the other shirts when it was on. I think it might have been ever so slightly longer (maybe 1\") than the others. It was personally my least favorite because of the crew neck, but fine otherwise, and also a great option. :) Alta Gracia NCAA Miami Hurricanes Women's Short Sleeve Spun Scoop Tee, Green, Large ranked second place for me. The scoop neck stretched just enough to be able to nurse in it, and the material was typical stretchy t-shirt material, but I noticed the cut could have been better, as there was some minor bunching at the shoulders (as seen in that product image on the product page,) BUT I was able to find matching shirts for my two youngest kids with this toddler shirt NCAA Miami Hurricanes Toddler Short Sleeve Tee, 2 Toddler, Dark Green !! Again, this shirt took the cake for me. Looking forward to wearing this all season long! Go Canes!"

I wanted something to remind me whenever I look into the mirror of who I am (Christian) and to remind me of not just my faith, but my actions. That being said, I purchased this Cross sometime in 2018. Since that time it has been on my neck 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. The longest it's been off of my neck is about 10 hours, and that being because I didn't want to look in the mirror and see it, I just wanted to be mad. The Cross is still as shiny as the day I purchased it. The chain is still strong. It is more that what I was expecting and what I paid for. I would recommend it to a friend."

They are virtually identical, except that the other one sold for a fraction of the price. I will say, however, that this one being heavier (titanium is extremely light) and more aesthetically pleasing, is hands-down my favorite of the two. Four Stars only because they use the word Titanium in the title description (and it is currently being touted as \"Amazon's Choice for 'titanium cross'\") when in fact every other description of this cross states - stainless steel.

      "text": "Well now!!! This one's something special, isn't it? A little nicer than the rest. Of all the Casio's I own, this PRW-3500 is my favorite. NOTE: This watch's LCD display is MUCH clearer and brighter than the Amazon image(s) show! See other web images, it's very impressive. For comparison, I currently own: PRG-270-1 (black, some orange print) PRG-270D-7CR (titanium band) PRW-3000-2BCR (blue/purple) GW-9400-1CR Rangeman WV-300 Wave Ceptor (discontinued) And now, the PRW-3500-1CR All of the new Casio sensor v3.0 watches have come a long way in accuracy. Where I couldn't accurately calibrate the earlier Pathfinders, I can now calibrate everything and get very accurate readings with the new Pro Trek series. Here are some comments on the functions: COMPASS: Very accurate, works as good as my mechanical compasses. The movable bezel on this model is redundant, but still very useful and looks classy. Note: all magnetic compasses are negatively affected by magnetism, metal objects, etc. Best not to be used in the car, near electrical equipment or audio speakers which have powerful magnets. Best out in the field - and always calibrate right before using. BAROMETER: Accurate to within .05 inHg. More accurate than than my iPhone Weather Channel App, because it's real-time, whereas with the phone app you have to wait for periodic updates plus there may be a discrepancy due to the Weather Channels' sensor location(s). The barometer's Weather Alert mode works great on all of my Pro Trek's. Activate it when you know foul weather is coming over the next 24 hrs, and it will alert you when storms are approaching. Also good for camping & hiking - you can activate it to be alerted about any sudden storm approaching so that you have enough time to find cover. ALTIMETER: Affected by air pressure, so accuracy is more general, although the reading intervals have been improved. Best for hiking than car rides because snapshot intervals aren't suited for fast movement across terrain, they're suited for walking and cycling. Also, if you're hiking and a storm is approaching, your readings will not be accurate because changes to the barometric pressure will affect the altimeter readings. best use in stable weather. That said, it truly is the best technology available short of a GPS device. TEMPERATURE: Very accurate. I have all of my Pro Trek's calibrated using a small electronic temperature gauge, and all of them read exactly the same as my wall-mounted digital temperature gauge (when located at the same location as the watches). You have to take the watch off to get accurate readings, and this will probably never change due to the proximity of the sensor to your body. The sensors are very sensitive - simply picking up the watch will effect the reading. I recommend keeping it off for 30 minutes (not 10, 15 or even 20) to give the watch enough time to fully acclimate. If temperate is important to you, clip the watch to your backpack or tent. Do not leave it in the sun. BACKLIGHT: Works great. I love the brighter illumination of the new LED lights. In pitch dark you may be able to find items in your tent. I am very happy that Casio changed the afterglow limit from 1 second to 3 seconds. A one-second backlight limit (Pathfinder series) on any watch is an immediate deal breaker for me. I love the backlight's Auto-On feature: I wear one to bed and just flick my wrist to see the time whenever I wake in the middle of the night. I also love the location and knurled feel of the backight button - easy to feel in the dark. BATTERY: I've been using a couple of these models for a while now and have yet to see a fully charged battery reach Medium from normal use. I suppose you can run it down pretty quickly if you keep using the backlight too much. When they're new I'll leave them on a sunny window sill all day for the first couple of days for maximum charge. After that I regularly put them in a window sill once or twice a week for several hours just to keep them topped them off. ATOMIC TIMEKEEPING: Reception depends on your area and current weather conditions. This function only works at night, (usually 4am for me), even when wearing the watch. It doesn't work well for me on cloudy or bad weather nights, but you don't need to calibrate more often than once a week even if you're particular about accuracy. Don't expect to be able to calibrate 24 hrs a day unless you live very close to the radio transmission. I've got an Atomic Casio from 10 years ago and it has always synchronized, usually without me having to place it in a window. Keep it away from magnetic items like audio speakers. ALARMS: The 5 alarms are cool to have, but there's no way to label them to distinguish which alarm is for what purpose. I love the Snooze alarm - however, I do wish it had the ability to choose specific days of the week, such as only M-F (exclude weekends). So it's either all or nothing with the alarms - you'll have to remember to turn them off when you don't need them to be on. The alarms on the Pro Trek's are about as loud as they get with Casio watches. Just so you know, if these aren't loud enough for you, don't bother looking at other digital watches. I also have the Casio G-Shock Rangeman (much more expensive than the Pro Treks) and its alarms aren't even as loud as the Pro Treks (that's not to discredit the Rangemen, it's an incredible timepiece!). So in any case, if you're going to wear your digital watch covered by the sleeve of your Gor-Tex down-lined wilderness coat in 20 MPH winds - it's not likely you're going to hear the alarms. And I doubt you'll hear them in your nylon tent flapping in the winds at the top of that mountain peak either. It's just not gonna happen. In fairness, I know of no other digital watches that are louder. And for those who think a vibration feature is the answer, imagine the cost, size and need for more battery power being a major obstacle. SUNRISE/SUNSET: Once I properly calibrated for the LAT/LONG of my exact location, this feature is now in perfect sync with The Weather Channel app on my iPhone. (You'll have to find the lat/long website calculator for your area, Amazon won't allow me to post the link.) Other functions such as the stopwatch, countdown timer, world time, hourly chime, etc. are all standard features, and work as well as you would expect. v3.0 ProTrek watches are as accurate as the technology gets without GPS, but here's the best thing: they are the simplest effective gadgets to use! No batteries to change, no need to ever set the time and date again, and the user-interface is intuitive (after a quick read through the booklet). And the learning curve, if there even is one, is low and even fun. The instructions are great, and provide lots of important tips for best use. ONLY ONE CON: The band is very difficult to remove on my PRG-270-1, and this one is even more difficult due to the hole in the rubber strap retainer. It's very frustrating trying to get the strap to slide out from under that retainer. The best way I've found so far is you have to be able to use one hand to both pull the strap out while also squeezing the rubber retainer enough to get the strap's hump out from under it. This would make more sense if you own the watch and can see it visually. But this is by no means a deal breaker, as long as I can get the watch off without breaking it, I'm OK. Highly recommended!! I'm very excited to own this beautifully made electronic timepiece. Casio has come a long way. Don't hesitate to buy one!"

      "text": "I've had several atomic solar Casio watches over the years and they have been tough as nails and have lasted forever. So when I wanted a new one with some extra features for outdoor activities, this is the watch I chose. Atomic time? Check. Solar charging? Check. Waterproof to 20bar? Yes. Compass? Yes. That's all of the boxes I needed checked. Watch does run on the larger side but is not heavy compared to others in this size range. Display is clear and backlight works well. (I had originally bought the PRW-3510Y-8CR which has the inverted display but I found that the inverted LCD to be difficult to read. The PRW-3500 is much easier to read in daylight.) My biggest gripe is the band. The resin bands that come with many Casio watches are stiff and this watch is no exception. Like I said, I had originally ordered the PRW-3510Y-8CR which is the same watch but with inverted display and a green band. The green band is made of rubber and is much more compliant and comfortable than the one that comes with this watch. I don't know why Casio would choose to put a rubber watch band on one model and not the others. Also, the band on this watch pulls arm hair like no other watch I have ever had. There are two \"pads\" by the watch bezel where the band is attached. They can move and trap hair under them which pulls every time the watch moves on your wrist. I was able to correct the problem by trimming the pads to provide a gap between the pad and the bezel. This stopped the hair pulling immediately. I can now love my Protrek 3500!"

      "text": "Being a newer, more tech savvy Casio ProTrek digital men's wristwatch with a plethora of functions, this timepiece is by far the MOST capable, accurate, resilient, and feature packed wristwatch by Casio ProTek that I currently own, and love! Among its numerous attributes include atomic time keeping, 4 alarms plus snooze function, a compass display, barometric pressure reading, current temperature data, sunrise/sunset information, as well as an altimeter function that are in increments of 5 feet, which I find MOST useful for everyday use. Along with those amenities, this watch from Casio even has 48 world time readings (31 time zones), an intuitive stopwatch function with a countdown timer, and it can automatically adjust for daylight savings time. One minor caveat is for such an elaborate and amazing watch, the included resin band is rather basic and not as comfortable as my previous ProTek watch, which was the one that had moon phase and tide data capabilities. On the other hand, I especially appreciate the bold time display that appears on the sturdy bezel, since my last one had a rather small time reading on it. Overall, this ProTrek item is excellent, and I certainly recommend it highly to others!"

      "text": "Let me start with this. There is one thing I would improve on this watch. Watch strap! It is nice and somewhat comfortable, my wrist is in the middle of two links where I can not find the perfect fit. It's either too loose or too tight. Aside from that, this watch is perfect. I already dropped it from 3 feet to ceramic tile. Not even a scratch on it. Unlike g shock, I don't see any shock resist material but it sure handled it like nothing happened. Tough solar only took half a day on the window ledge too become High from medium battery level. Time is atomic perfect accurate. Backlight is amazingly bright. Watch face is ready to read. I added tempered glass watch face protector. Even though unidirectional bezel would've been better, bidirectional bezel is solid and won't turn unless you wanted it to. I work in marine environment and water, mud, and sun are three primary daily conditioning I have to deal with. Although it's not g shock mudman/mudmaster, it is excellent in water and occasional mud condition. Simply dip it in the clean water and shake it in there for couple minutes and all is clean. Buttons are big and robust even though it's not made with metal. Hard plastic is sufficient enough to handle some bumps and rare hard hits. Sensor is exposed plastic and not rubber protected like g shock, but it hasn't been damaged nor broken off and works great. I could've gotten the negative display model with anodized black bezel but I decided to go with this model because positive watch face is much easier to read when in a boat or near water /marine environment. As per my very first complaint about the strap, the watch strap needs some improvement. However other than that one minor complaint, I wholeheartedly recommend this watch. This recommendation is coming from G shock affectionate (also eco drive drive watch owner)."

      "text": "Well I have had the watch for about a week now and I think I know it well enough to write my review...I bought this watch because it is a solid looking outdoor watch that I think can transition pretty easily for regular daily wear - it is classy enough looking yet rugged, but not overpowering. Outdoors I use it only for very simple activities...walking the dog, hiking, biking, kayaking, some camping but nothing super extreme. First impression is that it is a well built, nice looking , quality watch. One thing I do wish is that it had a pop of color...it is a bit plain albeit rugged looking. I think it would be better if the NSWE letters were painted something other than black. Mine came charged to \"Medium\" and only took about 36 hours or so in the windowsill/table to reach \"high\" charge. I put it on and it was comfortable but it does pull arm hair a little bit, though I found it stopped after a few minutes of wear and really this doesn't bother me at all anyways. I set my home city to Halifax and set my coordinates for Fton NB. The sunset/sunrise times are bang on any other estimate. The compass seems accurate to me although I haven't calibrated this. Altimeter and barometer seem consistent but not perfectly accurate, although again I haven't calibrated anything. The temperature does read high of course by maybe 10 degrees Celsius but it is pretty accurate when off the wrist for a while. The atomic syncing so far is hit and miss - of the 4 nights I placed it in my North facing bedroom window it has sync'ed once (likely due to good conditions) I am just under the maximum range from Colorado time station by something like 80 Kilometers (I think ) so if the watch can sync once or twice a month I would be more than happy. Stop watch is useful for day to day stuff (walking running hiking bbq'ing even). I would almost prefer if the bezel didn't move although it doesn't seem to move so easily that it moves without you wanting to move it. I did a fair amount of research and opted for this one over a Master of G Rangeman G Shock because I was more intrigued by the ProTrek line and it seemed to suit my style more. You can find a watch with all these features for less but you pay for ProTrek and the higher end materials they are made with. Overall am happy with my purchase would recommend to just about anyone. A really cool watch I'll wear for years."

Very counter-intuitive -The barometer skips out regularly often missing stretches of several hours -The backlight can be set to come on for 3 seconds at most. My previous watch, a cheap timex, had a feature called afterglow where the backlight would stay on as long as you were pressing buttons.

      "text": "As I'm starting a new job on Monday, I wanted to spruce up my wardrobe a bit. I searched high and low, granted there's a pretty small distance between those two as I live in a fairly small town, but nevertheless I was determined to find a pair in store. Belk, Kohls, TJMaxx, Rue 21, Wally World, Old Navy and then finally Payless. Payless was my last hope. I walked in, the women were rude, finally after browsing one came up, gave me the \"special's spiel\" and went on her merry way. I found a pair that I actually liked for $24 and found a pair of random shoes that were a $1 with \"the sale\". I also picked up a pair of buy one get one free no-show socks. I thought about it for a minute, and decided to search Amazon real quick....found this pair within a minute. So I decide to put my shoes back and order these; I did keep the socks though. I get up to the counter, and the stereotypical 'I'm angry that my parents are making me get a stupid job, so I'm going to be a giant a-hole to everyone' college girl say's \"you put your shoes back...?\" as if questioning my sanity as to why I would ever reject her special over priced black pointy flats and mulberry mini heels (the $1 shoe I picked). \"Yea, I didn't particularly care for the $1 shoes, and one pair at $24 seemed a little high, so I hopped on Amazon real quick and found a pair....but I would like these socks, please.\" *Blank/annoyed stare as she rings up the socks.* \"That'll be $6.87\" \"Ummm....they're supposed to be buy one get one free, and one pair is $3.99, so I'm not understanding the math there...\" \"They're buy one get one HALF OFF\" \"Oh, well that's not what the other lady said. *attempting to diffuse the situation* you know what, I'm sure I just misheard, my bad. *I know dang good and well I heard correctly. I'm 25 and I'm starting to get wrinkles....but my hearing is still fully intact*. \"You know, $6.87 is a bit to rich for my blood for just two pairs. I'll have to pass on these as well, sorry to waste your time.\" \"Yea.\" To wrap this story up, I'd like to note that two of the most adorable little old ladies were in the store and I'd overheard 'angry college girl' being super rude to them. You can be rude to me, but if you're rude to a white, permed, and short haired little 85 year old that's wearing a sweater which says 'I love my grandkids', you probably won't be forgiven at the pearly gates for that one...just sayin'. Now, onto THESE bad boys. The suede actually looks nice and well done. The fit is great, I ordered an 8.5 (my normal size) and their true to size. I will say, they're pretty narrow. I have narrow feet so they fit me nice and snug, but if you had wider feet, or bunions, you'd probably want to look elsewhere, or order a wide if they have them. Comfy to walk in, I don't expect blister, albeit I'm going to be sitting in a cubicle, not a lot of physical activity involved there. My only complaint (which is why I gave 4 stars), is that on the inside of the shoe, they didn't set the top layer down correctly, so there's a bump. That probably makes no sense, but I took a picture to show you. Overall great shoes and I'm overjoyed by the price. I will never shoe shop among actual humans again...only Amazon robot shopping from now on."

      "text": "Just got these a few days ago, wore them for the first tine today. I was pretty impressed with these when I put them on. Color's a true taupe the fit is SO comfortable. Ive got long fingers and toes and these covered my toes completely. The cushioned areas are well placed, walking is very comfortable without additional support though eventually I'd probably put in an insole anyway because.....flats. Size is a true fit, my foot is very comfortable including the toe box. Nothing feels cramped or too loose. The dealbreaker is I think the material which is a double edged sword. On one hand its great that its soft, because there's no breaking in period for wearing the shoes. Unfortunately that softness also enables creasing very easily. Ive walked maybe 1/2 - 3/4 of a mile in these today and and have a very noticable crease about a quarter inch down from the point of the toe box. I read in some other reviews about this but i thought it would take more time for the crease to happen and I could deal with that. This is bothering me alot more than I thought it would as it does ruin the visual appeal of the shoe. I was going to get the blacks of these too and interchange them daily for work ....but I may have to go with something thats made of firmer material and just try to break them in. I'm really not sure. Im not really docking a star for this but should mention that the right shoe also had some slight discoloration on the left side of the toe box. Edit: I've worn these shoes about 3 more times since initially posting this review, walknog the same total distance with long breaks in between. The crease doesn't seem to be getting any worse, so I'm guessing if you walk for only 15 or 20 mins at a time with long breaks in between the crease has time to kind of recover. I'll be getting the blacks ones."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 26, 2022",
      "text": "I live in the Northeast US where we have can have snow as early as late October through early April. We get icy conditions as well and it’s important to remain upright when walking in those conditions, even in your driveway. Yaktrax are the perfect solution to winter weather outings. They go on easy, will fit most style shoes or boots with flat bottoms, and are very durable. Once you put them on you can walk confidently through the snow and many ice situations. Because of the coils on the bottom you’ll want to be careful with surface changes when coming indoors. Ceramic tile can be very slippery so make sure you have a rug at the doorway to remove your shoes/boots prior to stepping on the tile. They don’t slip off while walking (unless you have the incorrect size). They’re easy to remove from your footwear. I have a pair of shoes with the Yaktrax already attached by my front door for easy on/off when I need to go outside. These are a great accessory for people with mobility issues that want to be safe walking outside in the winter."

However, I was telling my cousins how icy it is around our house and they said, you have to buy these Yaktrax, so on their recommendation, I bought a pair. However till they came in the mail, the ice was all melted. We live on a farm in central PA and the ice came back with a vengeance over Christmas of 2022. It was a mess and one of my kids remembered I had purchased these Yaktrax. So I put them on my barn shoes and I have not fallen once! Not even a slip! Love them!"

No more landing unceremoniously on my bottom during walks with a crazy big puppy! Unfortunately, one fell off during our walk today without my notice. I have written to the company about buying a replacement. Hopefully that will be possible because I do otherwise really like the design of the product with the coils rather than spikes. If they will not offer this I will look for a different product next time, one with a securing strap across the top of my foot."

No busses running. No police. A guy did video of him skating down a city street. The only way you could get around if you have something like YakTrax. They are affordable and work like a charm. They aren't too big and bulky, so you can have a pair with you any time. My daughter was the only person in her department who showed up at work in her hospital today because she could walk a mile in the ice with the YakTrax. Great buy."

Good on ice too - they find grip in any direction. I wore them over leather soles shoes (which are as good as ice skates normally) this morning and great improvement. They fitted better on the trainers but were fine on shoes. You can hardly see them on black shoes too, which is a bonus. They don't have spikes so I trust them to walk a few steps across my expensive hall flooring. My one gripe is stability. The bits you walk on cross over in the middle which means you feel unsteady, like your ankle may go over to the sides, if you're walking on tarmac or ice. Not a problem o snow though."

However, the material seems and feels extremely comfortable and looks simple but is really tough. As for it running big, it is mainly cotton.... boiling water in a pot, submerging for a little bit, then put in dryer on high heat. It did shrink quite a bit. Then wash in washer and dryer one more time with fabric softener to make the fabric soft again and not so stiff."

I’m 6 months post-partum, and they cover that mom pooch very nicely, haha. Love the high waist! I’m 5’7, currently 170ish pounds. I got the Blue Story, size 30 is pictured. Jeans have never been easy for me to find, they have never fit my waist AND legs AND butt all perfectly. But these do!! (I have a booty and always had thick legs) These Blue Story style are plenty stretchy. Side note:: I also bought a size 31, and they fit me a little better right now. (The zipper isn’t bulging as much as it does with the 30) But I know I’m going to lose more baby weight, so I bought both. Both fit pretty great. THEY ARE WONDERFUL, YOU SHOULD GET IT!!"

I typically wear a longer/tall inseam but found that the regular sizing actually fit best (short was an ankle pant, long was bunching up against shoes unless I wore heels which I seldom do but if that’s your thing, rock on). Literally my only gripe is that I find them to be a bit too high waisted but 1) as advertised and 2) probably more personal preference than anything else. Overall nice fit, good quality, washes well, and perfect if you’re buying them for what they are (high waist skinny jeans)."

XL is just a bit longer than the large which I’m ok with . I’ll be returning the large. You can see in my photos the Xl is longer with longer sleeves which I’ll cuff.

Apparently I didn't do my research good enough, this one hooks in the back, but doesn't open completely. So I'm like I can get in to this thing and try it on, well ladies, with 40Ds that's easier said than done. I get this thing on, after a few minutes,with the girls hanging and being smashed. I like it, good support, no bouncing! Now how do I get out of this thing? Well the girls were smashed again and a sweat was worked up, finally got out, bit I seriously thought a 911 call was going to be made. So all in all, I don't feel this bra is for the big girls, unless they like to be smashed. (Mine are still sore)"

      "text": "This bra lifts, separates, is extremely comfortable, and provides a good amount of support for stretching, walking, yoga, and weight lifting. It doesn't do much for bounce control for activities such as running, kick-boxing, circuit training, or cross-fit. I'm 4' 10\" however, and there's a lot of space between the straps, and my body. I can slide my whole hand/wrist between, right above the pec, and still have space plenty of space. If the straps adjusted just half a cm more short this would be the perfect high impact sports bra. I'll reiterate that it is immensely comfortable regardless of my inability to use it for high impact sports despite the fact that my need for a good high impact sports bra was my only reason for giving this product a try. the Showoff is a better fit for my high impact needs, but it doesn't provide the same structured support this bra COULD if I had the shorter straps. I did find some errors in stitching. Some of the ends weren't knotted off. Luckily for me it was on the exterior, and so I used a hot knife to secure them. Contact between fused plastic, and skin can be quite abrasive. I've noticed that a lot of ppl struggle to get it off. I criss-cross my arms to grab the bra from beneath each arm-pit with a pincer grasp, and pull up until the breasts have been released from the underwire. Then pull it off like any other shirt after that. I am claustrophobic, and it's very unpleasant, but it's done in seconds, and the over-all design is one of a well structured support system to handle bounce on all sides."

The \"girls\" are well supported without feeling squished or stiff. No uniboob either. The reviews I read mentioned repeatedly the difficulty in taking off the bra. I had no issue at all. Being big on top and small on the bottom, I simply unhooked, slid the straps off my shoulders and stepped out of it. Easy peasy! I already own 3 of the zip front style and was a bit nervous about getting in and out of this one. Will definitely order again as long as they keep making it.

I realize that there were a lot of things going on in the world at that time, so no biggie, but I’m used to faster shipping. 2) Poor fit — It would have fit cup size-wise, but the band had no stretch whatsoever, so I couldn’t squeeze it around my shoulders or shimmy it above my butt. I simply could not get it on! Perhaps someone who has no curves could do so, but this is outright poor design in my opinion. 3) Awful return experience — a) WARNING… return shipping is not free. I had to pay TWENTY dollars to send it back when the price of the bra was $44!! b) It took 25 days after they received the item to issue my refund. I finally received the refund after contacting the seller FIVE times. Not a good return experience or product!"

I’ve been wearing deck shoes for over 40-years and the 11W size has always worked well for me in other brands I’ve had like Bean, Sperry and even Dockers. The good news is they’re leather so they can be stretched and the bad news is I have to do it, they were a good deal at 49-bucks so I’m not inclined to return them and a new Sperry like the ones I’m currently wearing goes for twice the price. I tend to be rough on shoes even though I don’t wear them all that much since I don’t leave the homestead often. My right foot is a tad wider than the left so going wider just makes for a sloppy fit on the left foot. I’ll try the heavy socks and heat gun first them the rubbing alcohol if that doesn’t work… the last resort is bare footing it on a hot day and let the sweat do it. Other than the width being more like a D than a W they’re pretty decent shoes and even better so based on the price. I wasn’t expecting much of an arch support and that’s good because there isn’t much of one on these shoes."

For example, I wear a 1x from Woman Within clothing, but ordered a 3X in this shirt and it's still a little smaller than the 1x from WW. However, I do really like this shirt. It's very lightweight fabric which is great for summer, not so great if you want something heavier or better at hiding bulges, which heavier fabric is better for. I did not find this shirt to be see-though in any way though. I got the blue, not sure if it comes in other colors (maybe those are see through). The sleeves are a perfect length for me, almost to my elbow which is great to hide fat arms. I washed once with no shrinkage, probably due to the high poly count in the fabric. Overall I'm pleased with this purchase and the way the shirt fits, as it is slightly fitted through the waste making it less boxy than other shirts I own. Hopefully it lasts for at least a year without getting holes in it due to the thin fabric."

I had tried on several dresses at retail stores while waiting for this one to arrive, and am I ever glad I didn't purchase any of the other selections. I got sooo many compliments. I didn't need to hem it and my slightly heeled sandles were perfect for it. There is area with no beading on the bottom that you could hem if needed. The blush color was elegant, form fitting (but not too much) and flowing in all the right places. Looking forward to wearing again."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 29, 2022",
      "text": "I got the 24-30 month size for my relatively petite 2 year old. It is super soft. There's room for growth, without it being too bulky. I couldn't understand why there was a tail on other animals in this same line, but not the dog, but there IS one. It's visible in the very last photo, but my eyesight isn't the best, so I missed it and ended up buying a tail to add on from Party City. The tail is there, but the entire thing is sewn against the suit itself, so there's no fun/cute movement to it. I may use the tail I bought for Halloween and leave it off whenever she decides to wear it around, as toddlers do. She loves it and seems comfortable, so that's a win. It also has snaps between the legs, as well as down the front, if that's something you're wondering!"

I originally ordered another costume, but was then emailed to say the website was wrong - and that there weren't anymore leopard ones in stock. So, with very little time left before Halloween, I decided on the monkey costume... And... Just wow. Haha I will say the costume itself is very soft, so that was nice at least. I've tried to contact the company to get any kind of resolution but don't seem to be getting anywhere. Ah well. Happy Halloween!"

I could get my foot in but not walk in them so they were returned. They were gone in the 9.5 in the Olive so I bought the grey. Its a lovely light shade of grey and fit perfectly. I have a narrow foot. Listen to the reviews to size up a half size. The only reason they got 4 stars is they are scuffed on the backs of the heels when I took them out of the box and on the front of one shoe, the zips are extremley stiff to pull or down and they are not as high on the foot or the wedge as my linqs pairs. However, when I printed the return label for the olive pair and rang DHL for collection I was refunded immediately from Amazon which was fantastic and enabled me to buy the grey pair before they sold out. There will be a breaking in period I feel which there wasn't with my other pairs, I can wear those all day but these are fab. I would buy another if they were available in 9.5. :)"

      "text": "This is one of my favorite dress purchases of all time! I love a good retro dress and snatched this up when it showed up in my recommendations at such a great price. I purchased it in my daughter's school colors and intended to wear it to her graduation. Initially it was too tight even though I purchased the recommended size so this is why I deducted a star. However I chose to diet prior to my daughter's graduation and a vacation and so it did wind up fitting perfectly. At my current size most things fit me in a size large but this dress fits in size XL. ( Keep in mind I'm thicker in the middle) The ruffles at the shoulders and the tie belt helps it look even more tailored and gives you a nice silhouette. The fabric is very nice and light and once you iron the fold lines out of it it will remain wrinkle free. I'm so glad I got this dress and am considering another color."

      "text": "The dress is pretty cute. I purchased it as a backup to another dress that I also purchased at the same time for a \"beach\" wedding. The other dress I purchased fit exactly and that's the one I ended up wearing to the wedding. This dress would have looked better, if it had not been so loose on the top. I felt that perhaps a medium would have been a better fit for me, even though I had purchased large with the other dress (which was from a different company). I am a short woman, so I might have to hem this dress a bit, so it doesn't look quite as long, which makes me look frumpy. The armpits have gaps so I just wore a camisole underneath. I probably should have exchanged this dress for a medium, but it did not seem worth the time, effort, and was not environmentally friendly due to all the shipping back and forth. I am pretty flat chested, so that might have made a difference, too. All in all, it's worth the money and the dress is machine washable."

      "text": "This was a nice surprise for the price. The buttons were color-matched to the fabric, and they were also placed thoughtfully. The buttons were spaced closer together at the top, to prevent gapping and and showing your bra, and spaced wider at the skirt part. A nice touch and means I won’t have to sew a snap in like I normally do for button downs! My only problem is that the armpits were gapping and showed my bra if I lifted my arms. This is a common problem with pattern drafting in larger sizes - the designer makes the pattern in size S and then just proportionally enlarges it up for the other sizes, but you need to adjust arm holes when you do that and many forget. But I liked it enough that I will see what I can do with some darts. I am about a size 12 with 32HH UK bra and I liked the fit of the XL. It’s also not crazy long for a short woman - 5’2” and it hit a couple of inches below the knee, didn’t look super frumpy."

There is no NASCAR logo on the shirt or tag and the graphic is a lot smaller. The shirt material is a lot thicker and feels/looks different. Oh, and the graphic looks like that time I took a picture with my phone and had it printed onto a t-shirt. The pictures don't do justice of how blurry/out of focus and over all terrible the graphic is. I'm pretty sure if I took a photo of my size medium and got that screen printed onto a t-shirt I would end up with the same result as the size large.

      "text": "I was never a fan of expensive rings that is why when my husband (boyfriend at the time) asked me what kind of ring , size , finish, etc. I wanted, I told him that I would rather use the money to buy a car and/or pay my student loans . So that’s what he did. I just could not imagine spending so much money for a diamond ring. What I never told him is that I actually wanted a solitaire ring with a big round brilliant beautiful stone. I still disagree with paying such price, especially now that I found out about Moissanites! It has more fire than diamonds, it is inexpensive, it is lasting, durable, and it is 2nd hardest gem. That is why I bought this ring for myself. If anyone ever asks me if it is real or fake diamond, I would proudly say that it is neither. I will proudly say that is is made of MOISSANITE , a beautiful gem . Not a fake diamond, because it is not. Cons: It runs a little large for me so I will be getting a ring enhancer to keep it in place and enhance it, and also the prongs holding the gem are a little sharp, so be careful. I scratched myself a few times because I forgot I was wearing it. Otherwise, I am very happy with my purchase. I am glad I bought the 3ct one. If thinking of using it as a diamond substitute, I recommend getting a 1 or 2 ct one to make it harder to distinguish between diamond and moissanite."

      "text": "I love this sweatshirt. The price is right, and the fit is right for the look I was going for. It’s very soft, not too heavy, and I was looking for a shorter and more boxy fit. I am 5’6”, about 120 pounds, and I have a long torso. I purchased a size small, and washed it on hot and put it in the dryer on hot for the first time I laundered it. I did not notice a lot of shrinking, although I have to admit I did not try it on before I washed and dried. I just eyeballed it. I have some higher waisted pants, but don’t want to wear a crop top. This sweatshirt fits the bill perfectly! I can do a French tuck into high waist pants and it’s not too bulky. Or I can just leave it untucked and it still looks good, but I can move freely without worrying about exposing my torso.😁 I have purchased some of the Hanes sweatpants, including the gray. I can tell you that the gray of the sweatshirt is a pretty close match to the grey sweatpants. I can see, however, from a couple of washing of the sweatpants at least, that pilling might become an issue if not washed properly. And more importantly not dried properly. I wouldn’t go high heat with these items again. One of the pictures is the sweatshirt just hanging freely, in the other picture I am pointing to where my belly button is."

I wanted a slightly boxy yet slim fitting sweatshirt to wear with high waisted jeans, something not too bulky to layer under a jacket. I figured if this sweatshirt was a miss that was ok; it was so cheap I could wear it around the house or give it to my kids. I was very pleasantly surprised when this arrived - it fits just as I expected, just like on the model. It’s not too thick, it is soft and comfy, perfect for Vancouver weather. It hits at my hips (wouldn’t recommend to those who are over 5’9” unless you want a true crop). It is fitted yet comfortable through the shoulders, then straight from under the arm to the waist. The wrist hits just at my wrist. Has a cool vintage vibe, the black is a true black. My only concern is that it will shrink in the wash, in which case I would buy a Large next time. I will definitely purchase more though, looks great with my high rise Madewell’s and Levi’s and a pair of sneakers. Update: I washed it normally (Warm in the washing machine/threw it in the dryer) and it did not shrink, yay!"

She can still pull or kick them off, but it takes a lot more time and effort than any other socks. My baby is 9 months old and she wears both the 6-12 and 12-24 month sizes but the 12-24 seems to stay on better and be more comfortable."

I wasn't too tight and still looked great. It just won't be fitting next year that's the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars. That could of been my error too looking at the size chart. The jacket was softer than expected. I would compare it to an Old Navy type of fleece material. It was light but warm. The jacket actually has some shape to it too which I appreciated so it didn't look just like a typical boy boxy jacket. If your son is 11 and a little on the heavier side, I would get an XXL. My son is slim thick but any larger and I would def have to order the XXL. He can fit a long/short sleeve shirt but as far as wearing a thick sweater under it, I don't think that will be happening."

This one was a little bit tighter and seemed perfect. Upon the first wash I found the 6p shrunk to the size of the 4p and the 4p were now tighter than I liked (probably “normal fit” instead of slightly lose). I still like the pants and highly recommend buying them regardless of the shrink! Super stretchy but look professional. They have a thick material that doesn’t wrinkle if you take them out of the dryer right away. I wore them in warmer and cooler weather and find them to work in both. I thought this information might help those who are conflicted between two sizes - it may shrink a size upon first wash! Good luck everyone!"

So if you make fun of my pictures, I will put ketchup on you and have you for lunch! Lol So hubs is totally ok with the way things are now, but he mentioned that sometimes he likes \"a little packaging on the present\", so I have attempted... to do so. I'm five ft tall, 225 lbs. He likes that 225 lbs. He married me like that. But let's be honest, at 48, gravity is a b. Among other things. So, for Christmas, since I already spun alpaca wool and knitted the man a stocking hat (Again. He loses them), I decided for Christmas that I would order this...whatever this is. Dental floss? Red ham netting from the butcher shop? No wait, that's the fishnet stockings. I got those too. And red suede \"scre w me\" heels. I have to walk veeeeeeery slow. Anyways I am a size 18 pants with short legs. The waist doesn't fall gracefully, my belly sticks out like I'm 8 months along. Nevertheless, I'll be wearing the heels (hopefully I won't break an ankle), this. .. thing....and the fishnet stockings on Christmas, bc it will probably make my freak husband very happy. Then after he has had his \"happy\", I can go out and play with my animals in my regular t shirt and jeans. I feel ridiculous. Lol. Size up. This was my size, a 2x, which is what I wear in both men's and women's t shirt and my belly still stuck out like crazy. Was hoping for just a bit more coverage. And yes, I'm wearing leggings and a sports bra in the pics, you freak. Did you think I was gonna pose au naturale`????? Yaright. Lol"

      "text": "I do like this It is nice for those very cold up north days/evenings. It is very dark (I bought brown) and holds it color and shape in the wash. I guess I wouldn't call the sleeves batwing sleeves as they are typical of my other sweaters that are not batwing. The only thing I didn't like was that the neck was scratchy. I didn't realize it at first but then towards the end of the day of the first day of wearing it I had to take it off because it felt like I had a rash around my neck. I have washed it so it is not something in the dye or sizing residual. Other than the scratchy neck the material is very soft. Just before writing this I read more reviews and a few of them mention the neck is scratchy so maybe I should have known."

      "text": "This is a decent shirt. I love that they have these simple tattersall patterns - classic and versatile. The fabric is acceptable; a bit thin, but right on par or better than most dress shirts in this price range. Stitching is quite good! The shirt is also nice and long - which is excellent! There is nothing worse than a short dress shirt that comes untucked. 'Button-down' shirts should be tucked into your trousers and so should be an adequate length to stay tucked in. Well done here! Furthermore this is a really good slim fit cut! Nicely fitted in the torso, but plenty broad enough in the shoulders. My issues lie with sizing. I originally ordered a 16x32-33. My sleeve length generally falls between 33-34 in most shirts. I went on the lower end here, and it was a bit too short in the sleeve. My mistake, so I returned the shirt and was refunded (thank you Amazon for making this so easy). I then reordered one in 16x34-35. The 34-35 is a bit too long, definitely all of 35\" instead of 34\". I wish I could just order a 34\" shirt, or at least a 33-34 range, as those are my size. These sizing ranges just seem too variable or inconsistent., it puts me in between Amazon's sizes. Also, the 16\" neck is a bit too big... it's closer to 16 1/2\", but I sure don't want to step down to their 15 1/2\" size. I know this is picky, I'll still be able to wear it, but it won't be the perfect fit of dress shirt for me. I'm sure others can find a good size. Hopefully these details help improve the product, or help someone make an informed buy regarding sizing."

The shirt also has quite a bit of stretch to it. Sleeve seemed a bit long but not terribly long. Build is 5’10” 175 lbs, muscular with a 12 inch drop in my suits (chest to waist) I bought one, wore it once, and immediately bought another. My only regret is that I didn’t buy 10. This shirt has been unavailable for some time now but once every week or two I will check back just to see if it’s available."

      "text": "Go ahead and put me on team \"Slim Fit\". I wasn't certain whether to buy this shirt because some reviewers insisted that it wasn't slim fit and that's just a deal-breaker for me; I will not go out wearing enough cloth to outfit a clipper ship! Turns out those folks either got the wrong product or their definition of \"slim fit\" is more like \"painted on\". Knowing how things can go wrong with clothes sizing, order fulfillment and even flat-out incorrect labels, I'm liable to blame Amazon and their suppliers rather than other reviewers. Anyway, the shirt fit me as expected based on the sleeve and neck sizes -- and I love the fact they have half-inch neck sizes BTW; choose carefully and this can really make it look more tailored. They're 100% cotton and come out of the wash without too many wrinkles (wrinkle resistant is pretty accurate). A true dandy would still insist on having it pressed, but most of the time I can live it, especially if it's hidden under a suit. It _is_ quite sheer, as many people have noted, but as a dress shirt with an undershirt underneath it's perfectly adequate. I'm pretty impressed; it's a great value buy."

Colors- bought two different styles and satisfied with the colors of both. Fit- these fit okay; they are longer dress shirts so that they stay tucked in. Cons: Collar stays are not sewn into collars. I'll lose one or both soon and I'll let you know how the collar does without them. Fit- these do not fit like any other slim fit shirt that I own. Maybe a little slimmer than your typical regular fit shirt, but not by much. Other reviewers mentioned tenting because of the fit and I can't speak to this yet as I've only worn under a sweater, but it is a fear. Perhaps most wouldn't be bothered by a slim-ish fit; but I prefer a no doubt about it slim fit. UPDATE: When I wear these under a sport coat with a tie, they are awesome. So much so that I purchased 3 more and now have 5. I don't use the collar stays and thus far, have had no problems with the collars. I suppose this could change if I wore them regularly. They are a nicer fabric than say my JCP or Van Heusen dress shirts. And for this reason, I recommend. I'm staying at 4 stars because they could be more slim, but they are super nice shirts. Peace."

I think I received a used watch because it has 2 links with the red paint peeled off, and when I brought it to a watch store to resize, the staff at the store told me that the links (with the paint peeled off) were removed and then put back in - but in a wrong way: backward. Besides, there was no protector film covering the face and the back of the watch (but I don’t know if all new watches will have these protector films) and the watch is already running. Well, I guess it explained why the price was dropped about 40%. However, I still love the watch because of its vivid color, its cool look, and it runs well (I got it a week ago). There’s no scratch on the face or the back of the watch, and the links with red paint peeled of were removed to fit my wrist. In a word, I’m happy with it!"

In the last year or two, I have had to return a few pairs because of improper fit. I am told they are made by hand, so allowances need to be made. However, as much as I LOVE the brand, I write this hoping they will notice and improve their product. The black pair I just bought is perfect, but I had to return another pair as the upper leather straps were too loose and attached to the footbed at a different place as compared to the shoes I had. Keep the quality control is what I say to the maker. The styles are lovely and the shoes are great."

It is is easy to snatch an anklet off my ankle just living every day life. This thing has NOT BUDGED. Even better - it has stayed the beautiful color of 18 Karat and has not changed at all. I have been on a beach vacation, built sand castles, walked around with sandles, been in and out of the ocean and the pool with this on. Showers, lotion, you name it - I haven’t taken it off in over 30 days. I don’t expect this to last forever or keep its color through all that indefinitely but wow!

The weight of the earrings took a little getting used to- but quickly adjusted to them - as I normally wore studs. The beauty is distracting to others as this is so eye catching and rewards the wearer with many compliments and some staring! If you purchase this necklace and earring set for yourself or as a gift, you won't be sorry. My photos do not show the glittering beauty or the depth of color. You may be back to purchase another though! The seller does an amazing job at standing behind their products. They are also very kind and courteous. Update: Because my original necklace clasp broke, the seller sent me a replacement, from their stock, and at their cost. They certainly didn't have to and I am very grateful as this was my favorite set. I would certainly buy from them again as they stand behind their products!"

I just pulled the string on one side under the feathers to make it tight. NOTE: you CAN BARELY HEAR through the head piece, maybe cut small slits for sound. The wrist feathers are also bigger than most wrists so I just wrapped tight and tied a bow. I suggest putting the gloves over feathers so you can easily take them off as needed. Also, tie the feathers back pointing inward towards your body instead of outward over your hand, easier to use your hands. I wore this for 3 different events, it held up GREAT. I may have lost 4 total feathers."

  "description": "Product Description THE ULTIMATE HIKING SOCK A sock that works as hard as you do. Our socks are the most comfortable and durable socks you'll ever own. Read more MICRO CREW HEIGHT Sitting near mid-calf , it’s the best sock height for everyday casual and dress. A shorter, more concise take on the traditional crew height. Peeks just above the top of a standard hiking boot. ULTIMATE COMFORT No slipping, no bunching, and no blisters. The ultimate fiber for breathability and comfort in all conditions, the All Weather Performance means cool in the summer, warm in the winter. CUSHION DENSITY Cushion in the Hike/Trek category features terry loops under the foot , and in the taller styles reaches above the ankle for comfort and protection. Mid-level cushion density under foot. TRUE SEAMLESS Undetectable seam fusion for an ultra smooth, invisible feel. Darn Tough uses high density knitting techniques, which means there are more stitches per inch. This leads to a more comfortable, durable, great fitting sock with no added bulk. Read more SUSTAINABILITY Darn Tough aims to improve the well-being of our community by locally designing and manufacturing the most comfortable, durable, best fitting socks while continuously reducing our environmental impacts. MATERIALS IN OUR SOCKS Every material we use in our socks has been carefully chosen and tested to meet our rigorous durability standards. We currently use natural and synthetic fibers, and only 3 types of fiber per sock. As you’d expect, we are actively investigating and testing new fibers and yarn blends that do not appear in our current products. We’ve prioritized Merino wool throughout our product lines and our goal of producing the most responsibly made product is reflected in our commitment to the success of the Responsible Wool Standard. MERINO WOOL Merino wool is the most important and relied upon fiber in our products and accounted for 56% of our yarn consumption by weight last year. For many years we’ve prioritized the use of Merino wool exclusively from sheep that have not been exposed to the practice of mulesing. In early 2019 we made a commitment to support the Responsible Wool Standard (RWS) and shift 100% of our wool supply to RWS-certified Merino wool. RWS is a voluntary standard with strict guidelines to protect animal welfare and adhere to progressive, sustainable farm and land management practices while maintaining traceability throughout the entire supply chain. Although the market share for RWS is only estimated at ~1% of global wool production, the number of certified sources has grown substantially over the last couple years. Today, 100% of the wool we procure is RWS-certified. RECYCLED NYLON We use REPREVE, a nylon 6 fiber made from pre-consumer industrial waste that would otherwise be landfilled or downcycled. Using REPREVE instead of virgin nylon allows us to offset the use of crude oil, benzene, cyclohexane, and other harmful hydrocarbons that are involved in the production of virgin fiber. In short, using recycled nylon conserves energy and water and reduces greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing. While we aim to reduce our use of virgin nylon in our products, recycled nylon only accounted for 4% of our nylon consumption last year. We’re actively working with our suppliers to source more recycled nylon so we can incorporate it across our product lines. To date, nylons generated from pre-consumer waste material have held up well against our durability requirements, but we’d like to find an equally good source of post-consumer recycled nylon or yarns that blend both pre and post-consumer nylon. SPANDEX/ELASTANE We use Lycra to provide elasticity, strength, and form-fitting comfort. While spandex accounts for no more than 5% of the fiber used in our finished product, it represented 27% of the raw materials we procured last year. Like conventional nylon, spandex is derived from petroleum and has been important to the performance of our products. Unfortunately, it’s the most difficult material in our fiber mix to replace with a recycled alternative. When it comes to synthetics, we’re primarily focused on converting virgin nylon and polyester to recycled alternatives. However, we’re also looking for functional, recycled spandex alternatives.

Our backyard is the perfect testing ground to make the finest Premium All Weather Performance Socks. We ski, snowboard, hike, bike and run in the most unforgiving climate in the lower 48. It is under these conditions that we design, test and manufacture our socks. STILL MADE IN VERMONT, USA After so many decades why do we still knit every pair of our socks here in Vermont? We don’t do it because it’s the easy thing to do—we do it because it’s the right thing to do. We do it because for us, it’s the only way to do it. There are faster and cheaper alternatives but nobody ever outsourced anything for quality. ONE FAMILY - We are family owned. For 40 years we’ve been knitting socks in the Green Mountains ONE MISSION - Darn Tough is a family-owned, American manufacturer of end-use-specific socks. ONE MILL - Every step of the knitting process happens right here, by us, locally, in Northfield, VT Read more ",

      "text": "When I first started buying Darn Tough brand socks, there was a short period of \"sticker shock\". I went from paying $20 for a package of 6+ socks to paying $20 per pair. And yeah, the price keeps going up. But here's the thing...these socks are super comfy. They come in all sorts of fun colors, the fabric is wool and will keep you warm in the winter but cool in the summer. I've worn these hiking in snow and at amusement parks in the summer heat. One might care about the color combinations, but have you seen typical kids \"these days\"? They're wearing mis-match socks anyways. I've gotten compliments on these socks. I have at least a dozen pairs. This pair is one of the newer-to-me designs. They're on the thicker side and I love the cushion. Perhaps I've become a sock snob, but there's a good reason. If these wear down, get a snag, etc...you contact customer service. Send them back to the company and they'll give you credit for a new pair. And, well, I know there are people out there who can buy just one pair, but that's not me. I check my socks a few times a year for \"wear and tear\" but I think it's been a good 2 years since I've sent them back. These are actually the socks I happen to be wearing today! So, after about 50 washes (cuz I love them and wear them all the time), this is what they still look like. I bought these just under a year ago. The \"bunching up\" at the bottom of one picture is because I just pulled off my shoe and did a point/flex pose for the 2 pictures. For those that haven't fallen for Darn Tough yet, another reason why I like them so much is that there is no seam at the toes, thus they don't rub against the shoes. My hubby was having an issue where the fabric \"pilled\" and the Internet said to wash them inside out. That seems to have done away with the problem. Enjoy!"

While pure silver can be combined with many different types of metals, Sterling Silver is created when combining pure silver with copper . Sterling Silver jewelry can be composed with different amounts of copper but is most often seen with the .925 stamp, meaning that the composition is of 92.5 percent silver and 7.5 percent copper. This has been found to be a good combination for maintaining the silver's durability without harming its sparkle. Beautiful Gift Box Included Your jewelry comes complete with a beautiful velvet box that is idea for gift giving. Contains a plush pad that the pendant rests on. The box is also the perfect storage to make sure your jewelry is in perfect condition when you are not wearing it. Storage in the box is also the perfect way to avoid scratches when not in use. Caring for Your Heartland Sterling Silver Double Sided Oval Saint Michael and Guardian Angel Pendant Silver, when exposed to the air will always naturally oxidize, i.e. tarnish. To prevent this your Sterling Silver pendant is protected by a clear coat, baked on, lacquer so it is not in direct contact with the air. To ensure the longevity of this protection you should never use silver cleaning products as they will damage coating. You should also make sure your pendant does not come into contact with harsh household chemicals such as bleach, ammonia, or chlorine. If you notice any dirt build up over time you can simply wash the jewelry in a mild dish soap, dry off (do not use anything abrasive) and then shine up with a microfiber cloth - like the ones you get with eyeglasses. As with all fine jewelry, it is highly recommended to not wear your jewelry while showering or swimming - harsh chemicals can damage your jewelry.

If you have large ankles, you might have that issue. If you have regular sized ankles, I think you'll be fine. They close perfectly fine for me and the velcro doesn't show. I like these a lot and they go with a lot of things because of the neutral color that I purchased."

They are a high quality suede shoe and are fast becoming my staple this spring for both work and going out. The heel strap is Velcro and therefore adjustable... if they feel as if they are getting a bit tight (after being on my feet for a couple of hours), then I just readjust the strap slightly. I had shoes similar to these a few years ago and wore them out, and so I’ve been looking for this style for some time now. Glad I found them... I have the green (which is really a great neutral — a cross between khaki and taupe) but I may get them in another colour as well."

These are tight in the width. If you have wide feet definitely order the \"wide\" version, I went regular and perhaps this is my fit issue. The suede fabric is lovely and soft.

I’m also a 36DD. They fit perfectly. It’s nice and stretchy. Fits everywhere and now that I’m NOT pregnant, they still fit. The clips are easy to open for nursing. The fabric is comfortable. The only reason they didn’t get 5/5 stars is because the pads bunch up, ALL THE TIME. By the third day I replaced them with my own pads. They are always moving and bunching up. And if you go to wash them, take pads OUT! They will be destroyed. Other than that, love these tank tops."

      "text": "I was looking for some fitted nursing tanks because I find them to be the most convenient style of nursing tops. I wanted ones I could tuck into high-waisted pants/shorts/skirts. These fit the bill well. The material is stretchy and flaterring. I agree that the inserts are a bit awkward but I was able to adjust them. As for fit, I usually wear a 10, which falls between a medium and large. I got the large and am glad I did. I think medium would have been too tight. My only regret is getting the pack with the white shirt because it's a bit see-through. I now only wear that one at home. I wish I had picked different colors."

      "text": "I am a size 4, I was unsure what size to go for as reviews about sizing mixed. I decided to stick to my normal size. which is 4 the trainers did say size 4, but also said 37.5 which is obviously 4.5 so confused on that one. I think given time they may be a slight streach in the leather to allow more room/comfort, so glad I stuck with my normal size. I do however wear trainers bare foot, so if you were socks I would suggest maybe size up. I am please I got them when on offer. its worth adding the item to your watch list as I have found sellers oftern adjust the prices throughout the week/month etc. I love the design and there is a slight height but nothing chavvy so a respectable 46 year old like myself can wear them without feeling a schoolkid lol."

The up/down zipper makes it easy to get into the car, as well as keep the upper coat zipped while driving. The inner wrist cuffs keep you warm and snow free. The only disappointment is the (size medium) armpit and upper arm area is a little snug. I'm 5'4\" and 120 lbs, not an overly large person, so snug here is weird. Not sure yet if it's bothersome enough to make me return it though. And I wish it came in gunmetal grey."

      "text": "...sort of. I'm on a weight loss excursion and buy more exercise leggings as a reward and motivation. Searched for weeks and found these. Criteria was simple: good reviews and not $30+. I'll start with the material of the black pants. It's soft and stretchy, but not the shiny type. Still poly/spandex, still some compression. They fit pretty well. The waist stays put! Well, for the most part. When I'm stretching, my gut pushes and they roll down. Legs are a bit weird in that when I do a Cize workout, I do occasionally pull them up. What I hate most is the camel toe requirement for them to fit properly. Good thing I work out at home and alone. I'm short with a larger butt. While you cannot see through these pants, you will end up with some sweaty butt and/or crotch that's visible. I had my husband look, in case I'm blind. Anyway, I washed them according to the instructions (cold, line dry, no softener). Wpre them once and the chib rub is a problem...there's pilling already. If you know anything about Cize, it's dancing. High intensity dancing. How there's any pilling is beyond me and a little disappointing. I don't wear these leggings except to walk down to the basement, work out, and back upstairs. I'll be washing them on the active wear cycle, which is hot or warm water (no softener, throwing in the dryer) and will update how they hold up. Lots of reviews state the material is different depending on color, which is cool for me. I intend to order more in different colors anyway. How could I not? They're comfortable, have compression, and I barely have to adjust them. I'm sold. I do wish the material was the same throughout, but I think I'll survive."

The size fit great including the length which is surprising because I struggle to find bottoms that are long enough especially yoga pants. The only thing I found “misleading” was that these weren’t as high waisted as the pictures made them seem. These don’t come up to my belly button or even over it like some pictures including reviews show. Maybe I should’ve gotten one size up? I’m not sure. BUT I LOVE these anyways! *I have not worn them for a full day or washed them yet. If anything noteworthy happens I will update.* 5’9” 130lbs bought size M"

I ordered the black pair and the charcoal pair, the charcoal ones were more of a green/gray than a true charcoal but the black ones were a good true black. Neither are see-through and they are comfy but they do slip down a bit, I feel if I wore these to workout it would be frustrating but for everyday wear it’s not that big of a deal. For size reference I am 5’4 and about 170 lbs and I ordered medium for both and they fit well, didn’t have too much bunching at the bottom which was nice but enough that it would still work for taller people."

They are so comfortable I don’t even realize I’m wearing them. I like to wear them on the mid part of my ear on the outer cartilage area. The metal part without jewels is slightly adjustable, which make it easy to put on and take off, but also sturdy enough to stay in place while wearing. I’ve only had them for a couple months and I don’t wear them everyday. Only time will tell how they hold up, but so far so good. To be honest, even if they do break I will probably purchase them again just because of how cute, comfortable, and affordable they are."

These feel better on me than my expensive bibbers that I have worn on longer rides (centuries). Someone said in a review that the padding is too far forward. Must be a casual/hybrid cyclist that sits staight up all the time. I disagree because you need the forward padding for narrow saddles when you are bent forward on road bikes. P.S.

(I have a couple of pairs that I have been rotating) Very lightweight, almost bathing suit material which is great for hot Florida weather. Walking around in them is a little odd as it feels like you are wearing a diaper but they are not walking shorts so I don't fault them. Now I may need to find a pair of pants like these for when the weather gets cooler."

Shorts are not bad but after two wearings and washings I put my phone in the left pocket and it immediately fell to the floor - I discovered that there was a big hole in the pocket so that pocket is unusable. It also makes me worry that the other pocket will have a blowout while I am riding so I don't dare put anything in it. I didn't wear these for a couple weeks after I purchased them and I just realized that the window for returning these has passed. Unbelievable! I would recommend these shorts if you will never carry anything in the pockets - if you plan to, I would suggest looking for a different pair or biking shorts."

However, the shoe is too narrow at the toe end where the strap goes over the foot. I don’t have wide feet but these were a little too snug. I’d be able to get away with wearing them for an hour or two but probably not any longer than that before it got painful. The ankle straps are also a little short. I have average sized ankles but I could only do them up on the last (loosest) hole. One of the ankle straps was about a cm shorter than the other as well. If I had kept them I would have had to extend the length of the ankle straps. Overall a really cute shoe but it would be better suited for narrow feet and very slender slender ankles!

It has a ton of stretch and is flattering bout high on the waist and lower around the hips. The color is nice and dark and the stitching is well done! The bad: THE SMELL!!! My god the smell. I was blasted with chemical fragrance as soon as I opened the packaging. The skirt itself was slightly damp as if it weren’t done drying after the dye job: I had to wash it twice to get the smell to go away. The material is a LOT thinner than I expected it to be for $30. I’m not sure how well it’ll hold up over time since I got it mostly to do my chores such as maintaining the garden and chickens. We’ll see. And finally, the sizing is strange. I’m usually a large but ordered a medium and it’s a bit too big. I would probably be fine with a small which I’m totally ok with I just wish I would have known"

I expected this to be an underboob situation like a lot of my crop tops, but it's actually just shy of being normal shirt length - it touches the top of my high-waisted shorts. The material is a little thin, but no moreso than any other light-colored shirt might be. It's comfy! The sleeves are a good length, so it doesn't look like I'm wearing a too-small shirt. I can almost pull them over my hands."

It was the only chronograph woman's watch we found that had \"tachymeter\" increment display that she wants on a watch, and the price was affordable. The tachymeter is somewhat visible on one side of the photo but not the other side. I took a chance and purchased it anyway. When the item arrived and examined at actual size—not the enlarged photo size— the tachymeter practically invisible. Even with a magnifying glass it was difficult to see. I also realized the dials were all bone white as opposed to the toned down grey shown on the photo. Additionally disturbing to the eye were the hour numbers 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, which are awkwardly chopped up appearing more like an accident of white paint fell in those spots. Unfortunately, I was forced to return the item without even removing it from its box."

I can not say the same of the seller; who unfortunately did not check to see if the watch battery was any good. With all new victorinox watches(perhaps with all new watches for that matter) a small spacer will be between the time adjustment knob and the casing--unfortunately it was absent and the battery has thus been completely drained. Very foolish, indeed--walmart has better quality control. Such a shame that the seller had not assured satisfaction by simply making sure the watch would arrive fully functional and in 100% brand new packaged form. Tisk tisk tisk indeed. Luckily I offered it to my girlfriend as an early Christmas present and we'll have time to seek a replacement. I will be returning the watch for a refund and buying from a different seller. Perhaps an honest mistake on the seller's part but there is no excuse for selling a watch that won't keep time out of the box. 1 star for the retailer. 5 stars for victorinox design. Good luck and happy shopping."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on June 21, 2016",
      "text": "There are very few women's chronographs of both compact size and more technical aesthetic, for those ladies not attracted to the overtly bling designs that dominate. Being derived from a larger men's version, this model from Victorinox, at 34 mm, successfully blends a complex but clean design into a robust-looking piece that is still elegant. The colour of the dial on this particular variation can vary dramatically under different lighting - more so than any other watch I've seen. In most web pictures, even those without colour grading, the dial is almost grey, which I think looks great with the beige strap. See my photos for how different it can look. On the dial, there is a typical chronograph layout but with two different sub-dial sizes including a superimposed hybrid, creating more interest than all three being the same size. All sub-dials are concentric ring textured. The intersection of the chronograph hour and small seconds dial is continued, with some very artful and high precision truncation of the numerical hour markers. This way, a lot is crammed into the small space without it actually looking too crammed. These markers even have a vertically brushed finish that isn't visible in any of the standard product photos, it's another layer of sophistication for the wearer to appreciate. They are in a chunky font that, combined with the straight, bold hands, give more than a hint of aeronautic instrumentation. Finishing off, the tachymeter scale is on the inside wall of the case and there's a date window at 6 o'clock, balancing the Victorinox logo at 12 o'clock. The case back screws on, far better than the snap fit variety. One thing that surprised me was the date setting. Instead of changing with each turn-click of the crown, it changes with every 12 clicks, as the hour hand moves independently while the minute hand judders alarmingly while staying put. Upon further thought, the fact the hour hand jumps exactly one hour, and a YouTube video showing the date change on a partially constructed ETA 251.471 as used here, suggests this is in fact normal behaviour. It's Swiss so it's got to be right, and who reads manuals anyway? At £139 this is a bargain."

So I worried about spillage, but I guess it's fine because I've been wearing it for hours now and there's no issues of traveling or spilling or anything like that. Very cute, very flattering. The lace is a little itchy but I'm able to ignore it: the worst part is the TAG. I've come to ignore it for now but the tag is illogically long and in a really annoying place: under the left arm! Why they didn't put it near the clasp like every other bra, I will never know. Also, it's PADDED. Sewn in, perfect. It does show the line of the connection through some shirts, but I have sports bras that do that already so it doesn't bother me. One thing though: I thought it was a deep red, but it's actually plum colored. UPDATE: 3/31/21 When wearing this bra at work last week, one of the straps suddenly broke! The stitching came undone. Luckily I had a sewing kit at hand and was able to sew it back up, but if I hadn't, I'd have had to go home, which would have really screwed up my day. Now I'm paranoid about the other strap breaking on me, and haven't worn it since. Really disappointing. I shouldn't have to reinforce the strap stitching just to wear this thing."

Avoid direct contact with perfumes, body washes, lotions and excessive sweating. Don't expose to the sun or avoid high temperature. Clean jewelry with a soft cloth before putting away.

      "text": "I bought these shoes to wear with a pair of tapered pants, but I didn't like the way they looked together. I thought that the wedge had a little more height. The first time I tried them on they squeaked when I moved. Because I liked them and not wanting to return them I thought maybe my feet are swollen. After trying them on, putting them back in the box a few times and it was too late to return them, it came to mind they are new shoes. One morning I got dressed and decided I would wear them and walk the squeak out. I fixed breakfast, moved around the house a little and the squeak was gone. After having them on a few hours there was a little pressure across my toes when I was just standing but I adjusted my foot and was good to go. Again, that might have been my foot experiencing some swelling and not a problem with the shoe. I liked how they looked with my flair cut jeans, slightly flare cut slacks and a casual T-shirt dress. I haven't tried them with anything else. I really do love that they are super light. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they didn't (to me) pair well with the outfit I bought them for. I'm glad I kept trying them on and didn't send them back. I planned to wear them through the fall or until it gets too cold and I need socks."

      "text": "Very adorable dress! It's pretty fancy and great for my daughter's father daughter dance. I bought 2 of these dresses because the reviews said they run small or large. I find that it's true to size. My daughter is 8 years old, about 50lbs and on the thinner side. She wanted the hot pink dress (I ordered a size 9-10) but it only came in the next size up. The dusty Rose colored dress (I ordered a size 7-8) is her size and fits perfect. We are deciding on going with the hot pink even though it's a tad big on top. As far as dress integrity, it's very nice, has a lot of cute detailing and I'd highly recommend it if you're unsure about getting it. It is a bit wrinkly but that's to be expected when you order something online. I'll be steaming the dress and adding glow in the dark detailing. I will update the pictures with the final look. I added pictures of the dress before steaming it and after."

Nicely made and much better quality and cheaper than a regular Halloween costume. The only problem I had was the length. I wanted it to go the ground but it is short. Which for Halloween was fine but not so much for anything else unless you want it shorter. All in all a sweet dress. She was very happy and wanted them in all the colors!!! She is 7 and I think I an 8 and it was a perfect fit everywhere but the length. To be fair my daughter is a little tall for her age too! We are both very pleased with it!"

She has a 20.25” circumference size head & I was able to adjust the Velcro back of the hat to fit her head. The Velcro has great grip & has not come undone once. Her head sweats a lot so I needed something breathable & lightweight. I love the dark underbill of the hat for glare protection for her eyes on the court. I also like that the top of the hat is not structured & boxy so that the relaxed shape of it molds to her head giving a better fit. We also had problems with other hats blowing off in very windy conditions & this hat stays put & has never blown off. This hat is perfect although I do wish it had some UV protection built into the fabric. I purchased it in white to reflect the sun the best & stay cooler than dark colors. I never thought I would find a hat that would work for my 4 year old until she got older & I’m thrilled that this one is so perfect in every way!"

The hat doesn't block all the sun, as it is just a cap, not a sunhat, so sun comes on the sides of my face. But it is great for windy days, is easy to adjust on the go, and blocks the sun from my eyes. This is my go-true trail hat and everyday cap when it is too windy to wear a big-brimmed hat."

It’s not a super heavy duty material, it’s thin enough that you can wear it casually and not sweat to death. The worst part about Canadian winters is layering and then melting when you get indoors. This sweater is perfect for that. It’s SO soft on the inside and the perfect oversized look. I got a men’s medium! I’m 5’6 165lb, 36” bust and 30” waist. The lines are because it’s folded so crisp in the packaging, it’ll come out with one wash! I’m so happy. $80 at Ariztia for a basic sweater? NO THANKS!"

As you can see the shirt is quite big and loose which is fine because I don't mind a larger loose fitting sweatshirt. I could have easily gone down a size but I did want them on the larger side. The shirts are not overly thick and I can very slightly see my hand through the fabric but for my purposes they are perfect. In terms of softness - they are not that soft but also not scratchy or uncomfortable to wear. The inside has a soft light fleece so they are fairly soft inside. They are a nice bright white and would be perfect for tie-dye or to have something printed on them. For the price these shirts are a great value."

The xl is a perfect comfortable baggy Fit, the large is a perfect fit as well just obviously a little smaller but still a good amount of wiggle room. They both hang nicely off the shoulders. I am going to wait until they have been washed a couple times before buying more, but if they wash well ill be buying a lot more *update* I bought 4 more! They did shrink a little as to be expected, but no pilling at all which is nice! This time I bought 2 xl and 2 XXL for when I want an even comfier and looser fit :) I think these will be my new go to for plain black hoods!"

      "text": "The media could not be loaded. I absolutely loved this costume! I got a lot of compliments. I normally like to wear my clothes a little snug but I hesitated on buying a small, which is what I normally wear. I had no issues with the medium and it fit well. Maybe the small would have not fit correctly over my bust? or may even have had a big problem trying to zip it back up when using the restroom and damaging the costume. I am a 38D, weigh 133 lbs. I read many complaints about the swords as well. That they are too small and that there is no way to carry them on your back or that they are plastic like and childish. It is a costume and for play so of course they will be plastic. They didn't look childish to me and looked great with my costume. Real swords would probably get you into trouble hahaa. I slid the swords under the costume on my back behind my neck and had no problems and did not have to carry them all night. They stood up well and they actually did look like the picture. But if you want to actually carry them in a backpack, you may want to invest in a childs backpack sword. I also wore a black bra under my costume just to avoid any slips with my bust lol. The material does move around as you are moving around but with my black bra on, I wasn't even worried about that area being moved around. The mask that it comes with is a little on the large side. But that's ok, I just wore my own black mask and it looked perfect! I had no problems with the arm sleeve. Yes, it is a bodysuit but I had no problems unzipping myself to use the restroom. Don't get this too tight because you will have a hard time trying to zip this back up yourself, and may risk ripping the material or breaking the zipper. Again, I had no problem unzipping and zipping back up myself to use the restroom. I guess if you are flexible with your arms then you won't have a problem :) Otherwise, do get help. All in all, this costume was one of my best I've worn!"

My only complaints are that the face mask and the neckline of the costume were a bit defective. The face mask was cut waaaaay too large for a normal face lol The holes that are meant to go over your ears to keep the mask in place on your face were extremely far apart so I just opted to pull the mask tight and knot it behind my head under my ponytail. My bf had to take in the neck of the costume because it fit kind of baggy in comparison to the rest of the costume. Other than those tiny flaws, this costume was perfect! I'm about 5'9 - 5'10 and weigh 199 lbs, so I got the XL. It was a great fit overall, even fitting comfortably over my full bosoms and lower belly pudge. I would have liked the netting to be maybe half a size more snug. The material is durable and doesn't have a cheap look or feel. I was able to comfortably walk around the strip and go dancing. The swords that come with it are plastic and looked a bit childish up close, so I opted to carry a decorative sword from my bf's collection. The arm sleeves are one of my favorite parts of the costume because they are a great fabric and look very good on. They are a bit snug so keep that in mind if you have chubbier forearms. But they don't slide down or get baggy as the night goes on."

      "text": "I read a lot of reviews before ordering, wasn't really sure what size to get since some people said order larger, others said smaller. So I just ordered my normal size, XL, and it's perfect. I'm just under 5'5\" and weigh about 200, a bit pear-shaped. This dress fits me like it was made to order for me. I decided to sew up the neckline a bit, shows just too much exposed cleavage for my taste. I sewed it together about half way up using a blind stitch so you can't even tell. I left the lower set of ties so they can still be used in a small bow or loose. And I may take the hem length up about an inch. But other than that, it's lovely. Extremely soft and flowy fabric. Even the sleeves are the perfect length for me. I did notice while I was sewing by hand, that if your needle isn't sharp the fabric could snag and you'd end up with a run in it, so be careful with that or with pins if you decide to pin the neckline instead of sewing. I am going to order some other colors/designs before the price goes up."

The only negative about the dress is that, as other people have already commented, it comes completely open on the neckline. I had to sew it all closed. I’m not sure what the thinking is behind that. You could wear a cami under it, but here in Texas where it it still ridiculously hot, the last thing I want to do is wear layers. It took me about 10 minutes to sew the dress, so I suppose for the price, it’s worth it. I received several compliments."

I am 5'5\", 189lbs, 36C. I am not busty, but I have broad shoulders and thick arms. I also have diastasis recti which causes me to look about 6 months pregnant. Because of my shoulders I get the XXL and it fits the way I like, there is a little extra room at the chest. The flowy skirts help to disguise my protruding belly and I can move my arms freely. My husband likes the dresses too and I get compliments on them when I go out. I wear them with bohemian sandals or lace up boots. The only reason I gave four stars was because sometimes there are quality issues like fraying at seems or inconsistent sizes. I just sew up the seems and the sizing isn't enough to be a big deal. I have also noticed occasionally that there seem to be dye imperfections, but they wash out after a few washes."

I have full athletic thighs AND I have a mature middle age figure (meaning I carry more weight around hips and thighs than a younger woman). For reference, I am 145 pounds and 5'9\". The M length fits - hem below ankle, not enough to cuff. Fleece is a red and black 'lumberjack' plaid. The jeans are plain with no embellishment. Good, generic, basic lined jeans. Warm in 20 degree weather. A little spandex (1%) helps with comfort. No gap at waist. No riding down and exposing 'plumber's crack' when bending over. (If this DOES happen, it's because the jeans have slipped down and the knees are pulling the top of the waist down when bending.) Wear a belt if the waist is too big. This is why I recommend snug jeans without any 'ease' or excess fabric. I have a 30\" natural waist and 40\" hip, and if you go by the Lee size chart, 8s should fit me best but they are too big. I bought both 8s and 6s to compare. Remember, the rise (height of jeans from crotch seam to waist front) determines where the jeans will hit at the waist. The rise is mid-rise. The jeans' waist hits below the belly button. They WILL stretch out a little, over time, while wearing them. I have not washed them yet to comment on wash and wear."

The recent cold snap made me realize I would need something warmer than normal jeans and not snow pants before we headed to the cabin. Every night we stood outside in negative weather by the fire and these pants were the best purchase ever! And the price!! I will buy a 2nd pair when my size comes back into stock. I'd be a fool not to. IF your going where its cold these are worth every penny. the quality is off the hook! I looked at Carhartt and Eddie Bauer but I just couldn't see myself spending $60+ on a pair of jeans for a few days here and there. These are PERFECT. Do Yourself A Favor And Get A Pair!!"

Put them on and they fit great - they don't look too bulky so you could wear them about anywhere.

      "text": "I bought these jeans in October '19, just before it got really cold. I have worn them several times and they have been washed a few times too. They wash well. i washed in cold water as recommended. I have had other lined jeans where the jeans had shrunk i wash but not the lining so that looked terrible, but these washed well,no shrinkage of either lining nor jeans. They can't be tumble dried so they do take some time to dry. Thy look nice on, not to bulky or anything, maybe the jeans material is not quite as nice as my other jeans, but it's not a problem for me. They do soften up a bit in use and wash so if you think they feel a bit stiff to begin with, they will soften up! Only problem I have with them, and the reason for 4 stars and not 5, is that the waistline is slightly to low. This is due to the fact that there is a little bit of stretch sideways, but none in the length. That makes it more difficult to get the jeans to fit nicely at the waist, this would have been easier if either there had been stretch in the length or if they waist had been a little higher. I just make sure to wear a long top. All in all, I am very happy with these jeans."

So basically made for short round people. (I had someone take them in as far as they possibly could) Quality of the denim is poor (very thin). Haven't washed them yet so don't know how they fare in the wash. Don't waste your money :) Thomas Cook thermal jeans are fantastic but don't go a size larger as they suggest. Sadly though their smallest size is an AU 8 and I'm an AU 7."

If you are quite busy or rely on stretch fabric then this is not for you. I plan to return and get the correct sizing which I would say is true to size... I am also petite and feel it is the right length for me but would not fit a ta person without showing a hint of midriff... the pattern and shirt are really cute.

I picked the XL based on other reviews and it fits my bust great, without making me look hoochy ;) Only problem with being a busty gal, often times purchasing items for the size around, leaves most tops with a gap between my stomach and the fabric, or the length comes up. I will have to wear a plain tank underneath to cover my summer shorts camel-toe (lmao) however I am in love with the weight and feel of the fabric itself. Of course, the design is wonderful. I bought this for an upcoming trip to FL and Wizarding World of Harry Potter. I'm pairing it with a black, chiffon kimono/beach cover to act as my \"wizard robes\". My boyfriend's 11 year old daughter loves this top as well, and I'm thinking I'll get her a matching one in a Small. :) All in all, good top for the price. I can't wait to show it off!"

I have recieved multiple compliments on this top.. it takes people a minute to realize it's HP themed and everyone has said how stylish it is despite being HP related.

There is a yellow tint but hardly noticeable when you have them on. I will say that the frames were much smaller than I thought they would be.

I order the Purple Amber glasses and love love love the look of them but I'm not sure that I love the style of these glasses on my face. I figured I would try something new with round frames but these glasses sit weird on my face. I feel like they sit up too high on my nose and protrude from my face too much. Overall I really like these glasses but maybe just not the right ones for my face."

I tried these glasses, and sure enough, the tone of the computer screens looks warmer and not so blue and bright. I haven't been using them for too long, so I can't speak of long term results, but so far, it has been great and I can tell a big difference from days I use them to days I may forget to. The frames are also really cute and a subtle color. I got the Purple Amber frames and love them! They aren't super purple or bright, even from a certain distance they may look kind of brown. They aren't too big, but just right, and fit really comfortably."

My foot is slightly on the wide side. These fit perfect in those regards. I'd say unless your foot is crazy wide, these should work for you. I'd also probably size up if unsure. Probably depends on sock thickness or wearing barefoot. Really like the breathability. I can see them being ideal for summer wear. I did wear them with a medium wool sock already this winter in single digit temps for a short period of time without issues. Not sure how they would work as water shoe, but for general everyday wear, they're great. Recommend."

I even called Merrell customer support and offered to pay to have them made but all I got back was a no, but we will send your feed back up to sales.

      "text": "I love, love, LOVE these shoes. This will be my second pair in something like 10 years. The first pair took me for over a month in Tahiti and have been everywhere in between since about 2017. I got them originally because I wanted something hikable that would dry quickly as our trip in Tahiti found us on a boat for 2 weeks. I also wanted them to double as water shoes that would do a little more than sandals to keep rocks and gravel out. After that trip they've been out numerous times camping, fishing, and vacationing in other places and have performed very faithful service as an everyday shoe because of their comfort. I Love these shoes. They're definitely a very good mixture of just the right amount of lots of things for me. For my lifestyle they're like a sport utility shoe. Does lots of things well but nothing perfect. Regardless the trade offs are all more than tolerable and beat the pants off of most shoes I've purchased in the past to do one or two things. -First, they perform as a workable water shoe. They will stay a little wet but I haven't had many problems getting them to dry after about a day in the sun. Even when wet they don't stay soaking or sopping wet for long. -I would very easily trust them for hiking and backpacking for long periods of time. Although, I haven't done much of that with them yet I imagine some waterproof socks and wicking socks would complete the ensemble to make these very comfortable thru trip gear. -The comments about them letting in sand is true. Sand yes, rocks NO! I can tolerate a little sand in my shoes but stepping on gravel or sharp shells can screw up your whole day. They kept the big stuff out and that's what I really cared about. -They're very comfortable and light. Nothing overly supportive or gangly and tough to screw up your natural stride. Going on dayhikes are a dream. -Resilliant. These have been in the washer more than a few times. I must have worn them for thousands of walked miles now and they're holding up well. No delaminated rubber or anything unusual considering the amount of wear. The ONLY reason I'm buying another pair, in fact, is so that I have a reliable/fresher pair to take on longer hikes where I don't want to worry about a failure. In all seriousness, these have outlasted a few pairs of Catepillar steel toe workboots and a number of other pieces of footwear I use less frequently. They've been covered in cement, used to kick or push rocks, walked in for god knows how many steps, survived my disgusting foot smell, been washed and dried more than once and they're still in good shape and look decent enough to wear into town on weekends... Just amazing."

      "text": "I bought two of these in a rush as we needed them for a family trip, and this model was in stock vs. the spinner. While I wish the 4-wheel 21-inch model would have been available in time (that one is listed as: Case Dimensions: 21 inches x 14 inches x 9 inches; Overall Dim: 23 inches x 14.5 inches x 9 inches; Weight: 5.4 lbs, Vol: 46 liter) , this 20-inch model actually is closer to the Ryanair specs as of August 2022. (TravelPro does offer an \"international\" 19-inch spinner model on its own site, but that one has slightly less capacity at 39L and was not in stock within my timeframe. Specs: Overall Dimensions: H: 21.75 in. W: 15.75 in. D: 7.75 in. Case Dim: H: 19 in. W: 15 in. D: 7.75 in. Weight: 5.3 lbs. Vol: 39 L) I'm happy to report that this 20-inch two-wheel style met Ryanair's specifications with nary a second glance. Ironically I was forced to check it on a Delta/KLM codeshare, because the flight was very full. The Azure Blue looked pretty much good as new when it showed up on the carousel, despite being checked onto two connecting flights. Post-trip pic attached - any color variation in the full-length pic is due to shadows, not dirt. Azure Blue is actually a nice warm blue, first pic is just a little overexposed due to afternoon sun. See second photo for color comparison. (Actually the bag looked better than my also brand-new hardshell American Tourister (ABS) spinner which was checked on the same flights and emerged with several long scuffs. But they both did the job which was to protect my belongings and remain intact.) I appreciate that this TravelPro has some higher-end features: all the zippers, even the ones on the interior mesh divider, are two-way (i.e. not just a single one-way zipper); the telescoping handle has two height adjustments; the wheels run smoothly and in fact track so well that you can push the bag down an aisle instead of pulling it, allowing for more maneuverability; the grab handle on the bottom makes it easier to move when loading into an overhead compartment; it's stable and not tippy even when fully loaded and with extra bags resting on top. It does not have locking zippers though you can use a small padlock to secure the zips. My one caveat is that I wish the side grab handle was oriented vertically or diagonally when the bag is standing upright, instead of horizontally. That would make it easier to grab when it is lying on its side (e.g. on a carousel) or to carry when walking in close quarters, as if it were a briefcase. Last thing that I really like about this bag is that it is quite light (5.4 lbs, vs. other similar models from diff brands which can clock in at up to 8.2 lbs), which makes it far easier for me to hoist it over my head. I am >5 feet tall so when I put it into an overhead bin I need to stand on the seat or lift it in a full overhead press, so every ounce saved matters to me. Plus of course the lighter the bag, the more capacity I have for my belongings. Quite happy with this purchase!"

      "text": "I'm one of those who doesn't like to spend a lot on luggage because it takes one airline baggage handler to ruin your investment when that handler flings your luggage onto the conveyor belt without care or when he stacks up other bags on top of it. With that said, this carryon is an excellent balance between value and money: you don't spend a whole lot but you get excellent quality, durability, and functionality. I recently traveled with my TravelPro and found it to be excellent. It held up well to abuse, it rolled like clockwork, the wheels being top quality, and the zips worked without snags. The only design flaw is the side handle: I wish it has been aligned top-to-bottom instead of front-to-back, but both handles are strong and can lift a heavy carryon. If you get a good price for this carryon, you will not regret. One final thing: it has excellent volume and it fits carryon bins on both domestic and international flights as I found out during my travels last week."

I am not compensated for any products, (I buy them with my own money, like many of you) and I write what I experience in order to make Amazon Reviews better for us all. This Travelpro Maxlite 5 22\" is possibly the best carry-on out there for price/value. Yes this bag is slightly larger in overall dimensions (from top of bag to bottom of wheels, it's about 23\" tall) that US Domestic restrictions for some airlines (United, for one) BUT this bag easily fits into overhead bins. I flew with this bag on 777's, 737-700's and A321s, all without issues. Gate agents didn't even look at this bag and I didn't stand out with it either. Other travellers who were trying to stuff rather large duffels were told at the gate they'd have to check their bags. Bag construction is of high quality nylon mesh and other high quality plastics. The wheels are perfectly round and feel durable. I pulled my bag across airports, roads, crosswalks and the uneven sidewalks in NYC. No issues and the bag remains stable and upright when being pulled. I elected to buy the two-wheeled version versus the spinner in order to gain more interior room in the bag. I was able to pack 3 suits and dress shirts (in a suit protector I also bought on Amazon) along with some golf shirts, shorts, jeans, socks and other small items. All this without making the bag bulge or look overstuffed like a Thanksgiving turkey. The bag is easy to pull down a jet's aisle(s) and with its built in padded side handle, making your way to your seat is a breeze. Being super light unpacked, this bag really makes great use of space all without making the bag heavy when packed. The zippers all have nice pulls and are easily accessible. The main compartment zippers have connecting loops so you can put a lock on your bag if you are forced to gate check. There's a front zippered pocket which serves you well for your phone and travel docs before going through TSA. This makes emptying your pants pockets easy so you can go unmolested through TSA checkpoints. While an occasional reach around from TSA could be nice, I prefer to avoid such personal interactions. The front expandable section of the bag allows for easy storage of a thin laptop or iPad and some cables. All making for easy access while on board a plane so you can get situated before flight with your devices. I can see packing for a 5 day trip in this bag and maybe adding a backpack for some extras to get to 7-8 days total. Overall, this bag is a great value, well made and I can see getting many good years out of it. And with bag fees going from $25-$30, buying and owning a bag like this is a no brainer now. If you use it 2-3 times, it will have paid for itself. You need this bag in your travel arsenal. Buy it. You can come back and thank me later."

The handle of one of my large cases bent and didn't slide in and out well (probably because of a very heavy back pack on the handle) and the company sent a replacement I was able to change myself. You can't go wrong with TravelPro. They are light, nice looking and have plenty of room. I also recommend sticking to the 2 wheel suitcases. The \"swivelers\" with 4 wheels are all the rage but 2 wheels are easier to pull over uneven ground, less likely to have wheels breaks and have more room (the 4 wheels on the bottom take away space)."

I'd been shoe-horning everything into a smaller space than necessary or omitting stuff. More fool me! I'm not generally a brand loyalist but, after researching the alternatives, I plumped for another TravelPro not least because the old one is still in excellent condition, bar the knocks and bashes that some intense business travel has inflicted. They're tough. And in use, the MaxLite lives up to its name: despite being 25% bigger it's clearly lighter than my old TravelPro, the wheels have rubber tyres so it's quieter than the plastic ones, and they're enclosed, so less likely to get damaged. You can thump this over pavements and it'll still work. One or two more external pockets would have been nice but other than that, it's hard to fault."

It’s also described as having inline skate wheels. There’s no way you could use a wheel like this for skating - it’s false advertising, and the description needs to be changed. The wheel is a lightweight luggage wheel and flimsy - as is the entire piece of luggage. It has a pocket on the inside, but it’s has no room to give, so it won’t hold much, and the zippers are lightweight and a poor quality. I carry a CPAP machine with me that I attach to the handle, but the handle is flimsy, and I don’t think it will hold up to having the CPAP machine strapped to it. I’d rather have more weight, and luggage that will hold up to heavy use. My last piece lasted 15 years with constant use, and it was sturdy. I don’t expect this piece to hold up to all the miles I put on my luggage."

These wheels are flimsy suitcase wheels. The entire suitcase is extremely flimsy. The handle is not sturdy, and twists as you expand it. I carry a small suitcase on top, and I don’t think the handle can support it. The zipper is the quality and size of a dress zipper. My ski coat has a thicker and stronger zipper. The frame seems like it’s made of cardboard. The luggage is very lightweight but that’s because it has no strength and is a piece of junk. I don’t understand the good reviews?

      "text": "I ordered this Travelpro Maxlite 5 Softside suitcase on a Friday afternoon. It arrived the very next day - Saturday - just after 1:00 PM. Wow! Amazon Prime membership at its best. Another superlative Amazon shopping experience. The suitcase itself is a brilliant piece of luggage being beautifully designed, solidly constructed and expertly finished. There are no discernable flaws that I could find in any part of this bag. None at all. The interior is remarkably roomy for a carry on roller bag. Helpfully, there are two hold down straps to secure one's packed belongings. In addition, there are a couple of small pockets on the inside to place smaller individual items. On the front flap, there are a two additional zippered pockets. One of these is larger and expandable while the smaller one is suitable for documents and such like. The solidly constructed aluminium handle extends to make this a true roller bag. The black exterior fabric is cobbled, thick and feels very durable indeed. A distinct advantage to this model over the similar sized Travelpro carry on suitcase with four (4) roller wheels is that the slightly shorter dimensions of this model are likely to make it easier to store in an overhead bin. I say this because the two wheels of this model are tucked more closely into the base of the bag. There is also less risk of one of the more exposed free spinning wheels of the four wheeled model getting caught and torn off while placing or removing it in the bin. Otherwise, dimensionally, the two bags are identical. Lastly, there are two substantial rubber or plastic tips affixed to the base opposite the rear wheels to aid in keeping the bag upright when not in motion. Altogether, this seems to be a splendid pick from the range of available choices on the Amazon website. While a little more expensive perhaps than others, the price appears to be entirely justified by the quality of the suitcase. We'll see how it actually holds up on a flight (or many!), but all the signs point to the start of a long and happy relationship."

The whole stretch and velcro thing doesn't work for me and putting them on and taking off is way too much hassle trying to line up the velcro. I often don't bother undoing the velcro and take them off and then stick a hand inside to put them back on without having to deal with the velcro. They walk pretty well and are like not having shoes on. There is certainly no support whatsover. They basically give you some protection under your foot and not much else. Some talk of running in these. I can't imagine doing this. I don't even really like wearing them outside and I'm a barefoot kind of guy. At half the price I'd be pleased. For some the ability to take off and roll them up is important and this does work well but not a use case I'm interested in. At $100 these are overpriced. YMMV."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 25, 2020",
      "text": "First, I bought these shoes because the Japanese style goes with a number of African outfits that I have. The shoes stretch out and all that so they are forgiving and great with different widths of people's shoes. I've had the shoes for 8 months now, so I've had a number of occasions to wear them. First, they are comfortable and lightweight. It feels almost like you don't have any shoes on and light as a feather like slippers. I was worried about the stretchy material and the bottom of the shoes, but so far after 8 months they are holding up very well with no tears, deforming of the shoes or anything. Now, with all that I've said above, the reason I give these shoes 4 stars and not 5 is because in order make these shoes all stretchy, flexible and lightweight, the manufacturer had to compromise the construction of these shoes by minimizing the insoles CONSIDERABLY! So, while the shoes are comfortable, they can be a potential grind on one's feet if you are planning to walk on urban streets for many hours at a time. Also, these shoes are not forgiving on rough dirt terrain (nature paths as an example) or rough asphalt surfaces with those little black pebbles. I could feel the peebles digging into the bottom of my feet some. So, the SOLUTION was to get a pair of \"Dr. Scholl's Work Massaging Gel Insole Shoe Inserts\". MAN! Those inserts fit right into these shoes (you can cut them to size if you wish) and created a cushiony feel for my feet and now they feel even more comfortable. Because these shoes are stretchy and flexible, it allows for these insoles without cramping my feet at all. With these insoles in place, it really mates well with these Vibram Men's Furoshiki Black Sneaker. So, now I can do longer urban street walking and better on rough terrain I have noticed. So in summary these shoes are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I also recommend pairing the shoes with the Dr. Scholl's Insole Shoe Inserts if you feel your feet might be a grind and fatigued on certain walking surfaces."

I'm on the larger side, pretty active, but was looking for a shoe that wouldn't twist or come loose during aerobic and anaerobic workouts. Mainly elliptical for the aerobic and casual walking around the house without the worry of broken glass, wood splinters, basically anything you wouldn't want to step on with bare feet. Didn't want to deal with laces, this fit. Didn't want something that was going to retain heat, this fit. Wanted something super light weight, and possibly a good travel shoe, this fit. The first fit, these things wrapped around amazingly! The \"straps\" seemed loose at first when wrapping the foot and placing the velcroe pads on top of each other. Adjusted for a tighter fit, but this was to be undone back to the original, intended fit. Walking around for a few minutes made it apparent that these do not need to be pulled tight for a secure fit. They are just comfortable. Like socks, but with more protection. The rubber ridges on the outside of the foot caused no discomfort, really couldn't even tell they were there. First workout, kettle bells, various other anaerobic exercises, elliptical, and a cool down on the treadmill. These were everything I was hoping for for the anaerobics, no slipping, no foot movement inside, didn't do every workout out there, but they performed excellently. The elliptical took a little to get used to, foot didn't slip or move in the shoe, but I felt like I was and inch or two shorter than usual. There is no cushion in these things, so there is no rebound from the cushion you would expect from your running shoes. No soul to crush, no pun intended. These shoes are everything I wanted them to be. They are obviously a no-running shoe, unless you are a bare foot runner, then maybe... for everything else, yes. Not a formal shoe of course, these fit and looked much better than 85% of the pictures and videos I've seen of these shoes, where the toes looked like they were wrapped in a towel of some sort. I ordered in my exact shoe size range. Just got these things, so will probably update in a few months. Really hope these can last the better part of a year, if not more. Will definitely order again! Wish I wouldn't have waited so long!"

The weigh next to nothing and fold up small for travelling, which is superb. my one niggle I the small rubberated (definitely not a real word, but you'll get my drift) toe-cap, it needs to continue about 3-5mm further up the shoe. there have been several instances of my big toe popping up, out of the rubberated (real word now I've used it twice) pocket. Now I wouldn't be so bold as to say I've got normal feet, after all what is normal? I don't have freakishly long/short toes they're just average, so this must occur to other folk. Bottom line add that 3-5mm and you've got the perfect alternative to the repellent Sandal, a great gym shoe and a terrific all-rounder. I'm also going to say they make excellent slippers.

      "text": "First off I bought the original in 2016. After 4 years of wearing them, mostly inside, they gave up and I had to chuck them. Over 4 years service isn't bad though considering I wore them pretty much every day. This version seems hugely improved over the original. First off the Velcro doesn't make contact with the floor. The toe has more protection. The sizing is way better (Before it was XS, S, M, L and XL) and they just seem a bit more robust. I picked my size of Vibram Five Fingers, 9.5-10 (44) and the fit is perfect. Will I wear them outside and go on long walks, probably not, I have my other Vibrams for that. I wear them as sort of slippers but then can also go outside to the car/garage etc, which is a bonus. Highly recommended."

After reading many reviews on this belt i decided to purchase it. I wear a size 4 in a well made clothing and was not sure if I should order an XS, S or M (so many sizing vary so much). Eventually the size small was ordered and here are my findings: It is well made, the small was very roomy. Usually I wear belts around my waist or sitting loose below my waist over a long top - but I think this will fit as a pant belt as long as they aren't real low cut. For my purposes I probably could have gotten the XS. All in all - great find, sizing as stated and happy with the purchase."

As a result, I needed to get a few new articles of clothing including a couple of belts. I guess I could have cut out the snacking and added in some ab crunches, but, no.. The belt was actually still a bit snug. Instead of returning it, I just added an extra hole to make the belt about a half to three quarters of an inch bigger. I did take my new size and weight into account when ordering a size that has been accurate with other things. I guess that there is some variation and I got the short end of the belt. It goes nicely with Jeans."

But in light of the fact that I need them for Christmas Eve in 3 days, I had no room for trial and error so I went with the 2X just in case. Had I heeded all the reviews about how much stretch there was, and ordered my usual size, I would have been screwed. As another reviewer pointed out, the solids and the patterns are made from different material. These red & white stripes were made from a Polyester Spandex blend and had very little stretch to them, much less than most of my yoga pants and other brands of leggings. The fit comfortably, not loose, but not stretched at all either. I would have preferred the ankles to have been quite a bit smaller as they are oddly pretty wide. But I'll stuff 'em inside socks and boots and no one will know lol. These are thin and pretty basic, they will do in a pinch but are nothing to get execited over. I won't be buying more."

However, I was seeking out leggings that are not thin and sheer, but not thick fabrics like nay you will find on other clothing sites that cater to more full-figured women. Thankfully, I ALWAYS check out the size chart, so I knew before ordering I should order up about 2 sizes larger. So, I ordered these in a 5X and they fit well. Not too loose sand not too tight at all around the waist. The fabric is not sheer or too thin and the overall quality of them seems to be pretty good. I have worn these 3 times since they arrived, and I have washed and dried 3 times. So far there is no shrinkage that I have noticed. Also, no rips, no washer or dryer damage (that happens with cheaply made leggings), and no separation of the seams. They may be a bit more costly than I like, but so far, they are an ideal legging. I strongly suggest getting one pair, testing them out and see if you feel the way I do. I will be ordering more of these in the future."

They are extremely comfortable and definitely true to size. It's nice to finally find a pair of plus size leggings that aren't see through, comfortable and fit properly (in width & length) As far as the plaid, they weren't AS comfortable but then again I think I should have gone up a size. As you can see from my pictures, they are both 2X but two different materials. I think it's the polyester (and lack of stretch) that made them feel more snug. So I'd definitely recommend going up a size if you want to order the pattern leggings and stick to your regular size for the solid."

The elastic bands sits at my natural waist, which I prefer, as these are under dress/skirt leggings for me, and I like having the security of them not slipping down past my hips. They are definitely slightly too sheer and thin for not wearing something to cover yourself, but again, not what I intended them for. I'm just relieved these are legitimately leggings, and not shiny workout gear with weird visible seams. I can wear these to work! And, because they are cotton and not that \"velvety\" material we all know...the fabric isn't too slippery, I will be able to hem them nicely myself, and I don't slide right out of my leather office chair."

Mais les \"Denim Blue\" sont beaucoup plus grands et plus minces ; de plus, ils sont excessivement extensibles. Ce qui fait qu'ils m'arrivent sous les seins plutôt qu'à la taille et qu'ils sont beaucoup trop grands. Dans ce cas-ci, des 1X auraient probablement été mieux pour ma silhouette.

I look for T-shirts with larger borders, such as the collar, the top of the pocket, the ends of the sleeves and the bottom hem of the T-shirt. The collar is about a 5/8\" hem and does not wrinkle up after washing. The same can be said about the sleeve hems and the bottom of the T-shirt hem, which are a little smaller at about 1/2\", and they too did not shrivel or wrinkle after the wash. The pocket, however, has a hem of about 3/8\" and has wrinkled up after the wash, making the T-shirt appear cheap. Even the three other borders of the pocket have wrinkled around the border of the pocket and it looks cheap. I wouldn't pay more than $8 bucks for these shirts in the future"

I think I own about a dozen of them now. I love the faded old t-shirt look and comfortable feel. They are well made, double stitched and the color selection is surprisingly large - nearly 50 i think. They are even comparably priced to what's available at the discount (so-called) stores. There's nothing about them I don't like except when I used a brush to scrub out a greasy stain. The dye faded in that area. That's over-dying for ya! I'll just have to be more careful from now on. And with Amazon Prime's return policy, ya can hardly go wrong!"

This twin set seemed good value for money, and it turns out they are pretty much identical to the old on. Whether the lanyard clip will prove to be the weak point again, only time will tell. However, I got two in this set for the same price as I paid for one last year so I'm not complaining."

I'm 5' 7\" and 170 lb., so I've got some fluff and was looking forward to better smoothing than my typical compression leggings from other brands. They worked about as well as significantly cheaper brands. I didn't wear them for longer than 5 minutes so this isn't based on experience w this product, but the material reminded me of thick tights I've worn before that snagged easily. Pro--they do go All The Way Up. The high-waist is no joke, unlike many other brands who might hit the belly button, these hit my bra band and potentially a little higher."

Of course, there are no available face masks to be found (at time of writing), so after reading directions on how to make your own, I ordered this set. As a former healthcare professional, I'm not convinced that the use of these bandanas will be effective, as there's no way to fit them to individual facial contours, but I'm hoping they'll be better than no mask at all. The fabric is fairly thin, but these will be folded in a way to add more layers of protection, for filtering purposes I don't know much about different types of bandanas - I only chose these because of the price and the total number of items included. After machine washing for the first time, I did notice that the hems were coming unstitched, but I hope to not have to use these indefinitely.

Once washed with some fabric softener, they were quite soft and comfortable to wear. Extremely breathable. Quality of the material and stitching was as I expected. Only reason I docked it one star is that it's not square. Perhaps that's on me for not realizing what I was buying, but these are slightly rectangular which makes them a little annoying to fold. Not annoying enough to make me not recommend em though."

      "text": "I normally take a medium tall because I have a long crotch. After reading the reviews, I ordered an extra-large. They fit until I sit down. This means they end up too short in the back and my underwear shows, and I don't wear high rise underwear. The pants dip down in the back at least 2 inches below my waist. and 4 inches when I sit down. They are 2 inches above my waist in the front. The problem is that the design is too short in the back crotch length. I have noticed that many imported pants are now including measurements that include the front and back crotch length, this is called the rise. Most Asian pants have a short rise. So, for you who believe the problem is that you are getting too big, it is not. You may have a long crotch length. The front crotch should be shorter than the back, except for someone who is pregnant. Still, they are comfortable, so I will wear them around the house, or with a tunic. I have studied clothing design and tailoring for years. Clothing is not designed as well as it sued to be. Stretch fabric does not make up for poor design."

I’ve been trying to find replacement sleep pants for my beloved comfy yoga pants I’ve worn for 10 years that are falling apart and these are the closest I’ve come to it. These are lovely. They are thin and flowy but not too much, relaxed fit, and the waist has the right amount of spandex so they don’t sag. You can tighten if needed and it easily stretches for those bloated days without digging into your belly. They do run a little big. I got XL but could probably fit large with no problems but I like them loose. I’m 5’3 ish and while the length is a little long on me, it’s not bad enough that I’m stepping on them so I imagine if you’re taller than 5’7 they may be short on you. Overall, great value. Well made. I can see them lasting several years of frequent use. I believe the price has went up since I purchased my previous pairs but everything else has also gone up so it is what it is."

My party-parts are covered, but I don’t want to be in a situation where I really have to rely on the goodwill of my sister/fellow bipeds.

The first time wore them & sat down in them as a party guest, & the seam opened at the knee, leaving my knee exposed with the material further separating and exposing more skin. Instead of returning them, I expertly hand sewed the faulty seam in question, and in a few months will donate this lame excuse for \"French\" style clothing to charity.

After I received one set, I liked it well enough to order a second. I requested my wife trim the legs to a better length for me, and then hem them. She did, and they look nice! The second set I left long, since there's a hidden draw-string inside the cuff of each pant leg. It's easy to pull it tight for hiking or biking, keeping it snug around the ankle, and probably helping keep wood ticks out. The draw string has a small, narrow pocket inside each pant leg cuff to hold it, and a spring-loaded tightening tab to hold the string tight when you snug it up, so you don't have to try to tie a knot in it. The excess string is easily contained inside the pant leg when the cuff is tied snug. I like these."

I was surprised when I saw sequins since they don't show in the online picture but are a nice addition. The only negative is that the front is as long as the back and very loose but pinning it up to the side remedied that and it looks nice on. The blue denim look is really nice but I can see after one wash it fades so I hope it doesn't fade too much after future washings"

My only issue, and since I got this for just staying home to watch grandchild I don't care, is the sequins are already falling off. I did not even know there were sequins, so I couldn't care less. But how they're sewn on is a bit messy, the thread gets caught up on my hands from the inside when I put it on/take it off. Again, no biggie. I'd like to order another!"

I'm usually a 10.5-11 and the 10.5 fits just right. Good support but wears like a slipper. The quality of the materials and workmanship are top notch. Not too often that I do this, but I think I may just grab a second pair now so I have a backup when these wear out (or get eaten by the dog).

I do a lot of free-diving with minimal equipment and grabbed these because I wanted something that provided less drag than my board shorts but more coverage than a regular speedo. I was pleased with the purchase for the most part. That said, I'm not sure if it's ocean use, corrosive sunscreen, or my bulging quads ;) but after only a few collective hours in the pool and roughly 18 collective hours in the ocean, the seams began to come undone. They're still useable, but I'd imagine they're going to get raggedy in not too long."

These are supposed to fit you tight and the outer layer is supposed to be saggy to create drag as you are swimming your laps. Fits the way it is supposed to - I am a size 29 waist and ordered a size 30, size 32 would definitely be too big. 5'10\", 148 lbs, swimmer's body type. The sag looks cool (if you get the right size that fits tight on your thighs), if you get it too big then I am sure the sag will look ridiculous. If you are self conscious about your body this will not work for you. Only reason this gets a 4 and not a 5 is because the orange color, which I also have, is the true 5... amazing color."

I think I bought my last about 5 years ago, which for the swimsuit world is an eternity. A few suggestions...this is a training suit, and shouldn't be worn when you're planning to swim fast. You should wear a normal suit under it (aka a speedo). And definitely order 1-2 sizes larger for this than your normal speedo-type suit (I wear a 28 or 30 in a speedo, but wear a 34 in this). It does take a little getting used to, and you'll feel a little more tired than normal when you first wear it. You may only make it through 1/3 of your normal workout, take it off. Try to go a little further the next time. The great thing about this suit is that when you go without you feel super fast!"

I'm in my 40s and not a competitive swimmer, but call it 2-3 times per week for 2-3 years, and that suit held up like a champ. This replacement seems similarly well-built (how many items today seem less solid than the identical models they replace?), and finally to the point -- it works. I use this suit for my workaday workouts, and on the rare occasion that I'm in a race, I use a non-drag suit. The difference is immense. This suit is also modest in all the ways that a men's suit should be, which is to say that you could wear it around non swimming types (in a pinch) and not be embarrassed. One item of note - it does run small. I'm a 33-34 waist, and the 36 inch waist for this suit is perfect. Anything smaller and I think I'd have trouble getting my legs into it."

I ordered large for everything and thought I must have mistakenly ordered medium, it was so tight. The fabric in the front was designed weird, pulled way too high in the center, and was fairly sheer. Obviously you can change how tight you tie the arm holes but there was no stretch to them. I tied them first where it made sense to tie them in the fabric and then put the shirt on and the arm holes were too tight. Loosened them but then it looked weird as the fabric was designed to be tied tighter. The good/bad. Style B was a much better fit! I will be keeping the blue one as it's very comfortable, and hides my mom tummy well. However, while the \"red\" did look like a orange red on Amazon it is flat ORANGE. I was expecting a kind of brick orange/red and it's definitely a burnt orange color. \"Red\" is entirely misleading and I'll be returning this color."

I sized up to a 4x to ensure a loose fit. I have fibromyalgia so my skin is very sensitive and I like things loose. The top is just a bit more fitted than expected. Not horrible as I'm not going out in public in them, but I wouldn't be comfortable having someone see me wear it. It's just a bit tight across the boobs, belly, and hips. And the sleeves are incredibly long, they hang four inches past my fingers. On the other hand the pants fit decently, almost too big, which is odd. Why is it so challenging to find a loose pair of plus size bamboo pajamas?"

I purchased the v-neck in heather gray and it is soooo comfortable! I purchased them overly large as I didn't want anything at all restrictive. There was a huge sizing gap between the waist size for the 2X and the 3X so I went with a 3X but...45 inch waist on the 3XL would likely fit someone with a 60 in waist comfortably! They also have a ridiculously long rise. With the fabric itself being stretchy, I could pull the bottoms up to just under my armpits and it will stay there. As it is, I pull them very high above my natural waist so that they don't sag. Seriously contemplating purchasing a second set just to lounge around the house in. This time I'll get the 2X."

The large was definitely too big, so the supplier promptly sent me a medium. That was very nice, but I still find it too big. I'll wear it anyway because I really love the fabric. If you're usually a Canadian or American small, I would recommend ordering a small and disregarding the sizing chart. Unless you like a very loose fit."

      "text": "Background: I lifted heavily through my teens and twenties. After a long hiatus, I’m back in a place where I’m able to train consistently again. As I’m only ever going to get older (and I no longer have a training partner), I’ve been relying more heavily on video to form check myself. One issue I began to notice was that the soles of my boots squash down considerably on even moderately weighted squats, leading to instability in my feet that translated into an uneven concentric phase; my weight was shifting back and forth from hip to knee as my feet wobbled from heel to ball of the foot over the soft sole of my boot. Not wanting to jeopardize myself or my joints, I grabbed a pair of these. Fit: As most of the other reviews have indicated, this is a long, narrow fit. Those with wide feed may have trouble. Wanting it to be tight, I went half a size down from my usual (I wear a 12, I ordered an 11.5). This turned out to be a good call. They fit securely and well. I would not recommend doing anything but lifting in them as they’re stiff and heavy and tight. For the application this is a good thing. Function: They do exactly what I was hoping they would: my feet are no longer wobbling around on a soft, unstable surface, and my knees and back feel better coming out of my squat session than they have the last few times. My feet feel glued in place once I take my stance and I’m more easily able to distribute the load across the middle of my feet instead of rocking back onto my heels as I’m sometimes prone to do. There was no magical strength boost as some have asked about or reported (nor was I expecting one), but I’m now confident that I can continue to add weight to my squats without worrying about knee, hip, or back trouble creeping in. Solid product at a great price!"

      "text": "As mentioned, order 1/2 to 1 full size down as these tend to run large and you need a snug fit on athletic shoes. Normally I wear a size 9 in street shoes, a size 8 1/2 in athletic shoes, but I ordered an 8 and they fit perfect. Immediate improvement in squat, definitely recommended if you find that you cannot “sit back” far enough into the squat to be stable. Great for those with an unfavorable tibia-femur ratio, so the elevated heel helps accommodate for that. The tarsal strap provides additional stability and inspires confidence in the lift and can easily be loosened after each exercise. I mainly use them for squats, lunges, and clean and jerk. For durability, I have had them for about six months and they hold up great. I only use them on leg day and if I need to do cardio in the same session, I bring different shoes. I haven’t noticed any compression of the high-density foam heels. These are purpose-built shoes, so I don’t recommend using them for cardio or lifts that don’t need special shoes (bench, deadlift, machine work, etc.). Definitely do not walk to the gym in these, they are made for stability and not mileage. Take care of them and they will take care of you."

      "text": "I really like these shoes VS the Adidad Powerlift shoe, primarily for the style (I bought both, returned the Powerlift because they were HIDEOUS). They seem to be almost identical in quality in function, but I went with these because they don't embarrass me in the gym. However, as others have mentioned, order a half size down. Unfortunately the 10.5 (my usual size) was on sale for like 25 dollars off and I tried them, and found they were too large. But for the steep discount I decided to deal with the size, and I don't think it's a complete deal breaker. If I could do it again though, I'd probably just pony up the 25 extra bucks for the right size. Now for function, this is why I love these shoes: 1) While I didn't regularly fall backwards on my squats, there were absolutely times where I tried to envision sitting back in a chair and would sometimes lose balance rather quickly. With these shoes, that no longer happens. Or rather, it does, but I can catch myself thanks to the heel supporting me. I love that because it's safer and makes me feel more confident at higher weights. 2) Definitely allows me to push a little better out of the hole, and allows me to get in a deeper squat position more naturally. I feel like more form has improved along while my stability since I got them. Now that I'm getting into heavier weights, I very much value this. 3) I use them for everything, including deadlifts and pendlay rows. The lift in the heel is small enough that I don't have to change, I just use them for all barbell work. Deadlifts I do feel like they get my hamstrings and glutes a bit more involved, and rows I just feel like they give me a better stretch. For OHP I do feel like they give me some better stability and put me in a slightly more athletic stance. At 66 bucks, I can't say there's a reason to NOT them and I'm happy I bought them when I did. I'm two months into Stronglifts 5x5 and weights are starting to get heavy, and these shoes allow me to take those increases with confidence."

      "text": "Los compré para hacer sobre todo sentadillas y otros ejercicios para el entrenamiento de fuerza. Llevo usándolos unas 10 sesiones de sentadillas y puedo comentar lo siguiente: - Son muy grandes, normalmente uso talla 29cm, como ya había leído eso en otras reseñas los pedí talla 28cm, sin las plantillas me quedaron bien, al principio un poco justos, pero con el uso se amoldaron. Mi dedo más largo no alcanza a tocar la punta del zapato. Recomiendo pedir medio número más chico, no uno entero como hice yo. - No se comprimen para nada. Tenía un poco de temor de que no fueran a cumplir mis expectativas, pues el tacón es de EVA y no de TPU como zapatos de gamas más altas, pero no fue así, la suela pese a ser de EVA no se siente inestable ni que cause pérdida de potencia. En México los zapatos de halterofilia no son fáciles de conseguir, al menos no a precios justos como en otros países, acá solo se consiguen de forma oficial los Nike Romaleos 3, pero cuestan el triple que estos. Dudaba si merecía la pena gastar en los Romaleos, pues de otras marcas no se encuentran o tienen un precio muy alto por gastos de envío o importación, solo los Nike están a un precio igual que en otros países. Sin embargo, habiendo usado estos zapatos en algunas sesiones puedo decir que estoy muy contento de no haber gastado más, pues para hacer sentadillas y entrenar otros ejercicios de fuerza cumplen perfectamente. Ahora, si te consideras un levantador serio que continuamente hace movimientos olímpicos y busca la mayor estabilidad y sujeción, recomendaría totalmente ir por los Romaleos. Si solo es para hacer sentadillas y ocasionalmente movimientos olímpicos o preses sobre la cabeza, estos son una excelente opción de la cual no te arrepentirás."

Comencé usándolos exclusivamente para powerlifting (en sentadilla y bench), y debo decir que mantuvieron su dureza a pesar de tirar muchas veces mas de 200 kg en sentadilla. Después comencé a usarlos en halterofilia y ahí han aguantado muy bien de igual forma, por lo que puedo asegurar que el costo-beneficio es excelente."

We increased the size specially for fitting American female average head size. Heat resistant fiber looks natural and can be permed by iron. Colors and Materials: Half silvery white and half dark red. We blended some silvery and white fibers to create the unique silvery white for the character. High quality heat-resistant soft fibers are used to give you a natural and not shiny look. Read more Style: It’s an thick layered wig, long in the back which leaves room for styling to your desired length! You may also cut the bangs or thin it out a little bit to fit your face and get a better outcome. Read more Overlapping hairs: A small amount of white and red hairs might meld together in the bangs and in the back during shipping and storage. It can work really well if you like them blend together. If you prefer a clear line between the two colors it needs some styling to fix it. Thickness: Thick and natural hair, you don't worry about showing your own hair underneath. Wig cap included: It comes with a netted wig cap, so you won't have to buy them separately. Adjustable Cap Size: H igh quality rose net cap fits all, the inner cap net with two adjustable straps, which can be intertwined to a fixed position to suitable adult head sizes.

One of the wefts in the white side is sewn in sideways too causing it to stick up. I’ve bought a lot of amazon wigs for this same price point and found them to be better quality.

      "text": "Good lightweight boot tree. Helps leather boot shaft stay upright after wearing. (As others have stated, this will not stretch the boot shaft in any way; it merely serves as a support in place of the cardboard boot shaft 'stuffing' that most manufacturers place in the boot shaft for shipping.) These lightweight plastic boot trees are better than the cardboard--better support from molded plastic, light spring-loaded pressure, and easy trigger pull on/off. They are about 2\" shorter than the top of my boots (~17\"). I have only used these for a few days, so can't comment on durability. I would recommend these to anyone who seeks an easy to use, very lightweight boot form with light pressure. If you need a boot tree that can provide more pressure to the boot shaft, I'd recommend a cedar boot tree with curved shaft that follows the actual curve of the leg (calf) and extends taller than the top of the boot shaft. The boot shaft here has a slight curve/extension at the calf, but it goes straight up vertically from that point; not curved/contoured the entire shaft. Overall, 4 of 5 stars for a lightweight product, easy to use, keeps boot shaft upright. Shaft height is a little short for some boots (my boots measure 17\" tall), and spring-loaded tension is very light--would prefer a little stronger spring for more firm pressure on the boot shaft. (That is a comment for Ariat, the manufacturer, not the online merchant.)"

Much easier & cheaper alternative than either painting them or buying new boots that'd cost probably close to $1,000 to get custom-made boots with the same design. So, in order to apply the design where it looks real, I need a stiff pair of boot trees, and these are perfect! As you probably already know, all of the other boot trees on Amazon are NOT adjustable, and so it's touch-and-go to see if they even fit in your boots. I really like the design that allows you to simply grip the handle, push down on it to minimize the width, put it in your boot - and let go."

Pay close attention to sizing as you may want to go a size down. I normally wear a large, but I followed the chest measurement guide and ordered a medium. The medium fits well on my average build and range of motion is good. If you plan on adding under layers for being outdoors in cold conditions for extended periods of time, you may want to go a size up. My only complaint is that the hood is on the small side and does not extend out beyond my face for cold, rainy days. I don't plan on any rugged outdoor use so I'm fairly certain this parka will stand the test of time."

  "description": "Product Description LOOKING FOR A RING WITH A BREATHTAKING DESIGN AND AN EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE QUALITY? The search for the perfect ring is a journey in itself. One’s taste or style is often the main consideration when shopping for jewelry. However, quality is something that shouldn’t be overlooked - especially for an eternity ring, an engagement ring, or a wedding band. No one wants a ring that’s attractive but uncomfortable to wear. Subpar rings will only cause issues like discoloration or irritation, no matter how beautiful they look on any woman’s finger. The Sterling Silver Ring by NYC Sterling offers the best of both worlds in terms of design and quality with its hypoallergenic and high-quality build. FLAWLESS & SPARKLING Show off a sophisticated look with our cubic zirconia band. It has an exceptional brilliance that rivals even the finest diamonds. The ring sparkles in a variety of colors, making it truly eye-catching. This eternity band has a flawless constitution, making it a ring that any woman would be proud to flaunt - especially with the luster of its 4mm round-cut AAA-quality stones.

Read more SHINES BRIGHT LIKE A DIAMOND With the naked eye, even a professional jeweler won’t be able to tell the difference between our cubic zirconia band and a diamond ring. This is why CZ is a go-to stone for engagement and wedding rings. If you are someone looking to propose to your partner or a lady simply wanting a ring that looks like authentic diamonds, our CZ band is a great choice - a gorgeous piece that doesn’t come at the cost of a couple of grand. Read more SUITABLE FOR DAILY WEAR Diamonds are expensive which is why some women prefer to wear their diamond rings only on special occasions. To look their best every day without risking losing their precious gemstones, they substitute these with cubic zirconia jewelry. Our high-quality CZ ring is an excellent alternative to costly diamonds. Best of all, you’ll have jewelry aficionados thinking it’s the real deal. EASY TO CARE FOR To remove dirt from this engagement band, gently clean it with a soft-bristled brush. Rinse it in warm, soapy water then pat dry with a clean cloth. Do not clean it with chemicals or soaps. Maintain its natural shine and clarity by cleaning it every few weeks. Keep our ring’s maximum appeal by avoiding using lotion or powder while wearing it. Always take caution when doing activities such as laundry, cleaning, or gardening.

The seller replaced the ring. Thank you for the replacement. I like the ring it's believable, it's beautiful. The ring will last if you're NOT hard on your jewelry, which I'm not, but things happen and for the price it's NOT an expensive replacement. I still have the replacement from November and it still looks good. I'm buying another...For a just in case matter. My finger has NEVER turned green from any of the rings that I've purchased from the NY company. That's from the silver having a copper presence. Doesn't mean it's not real silver (925). Enjoy your 💍. Updating this review...I took both my engagement and this ring to my jewelers for a cleaning. I have the real deal engagement ring. However, I also was wearing this ring the day I took them to get cleaned. I was floored, the Goldsmith on duty wanted to check my rings and be sure the prongs were in good shape, from the request of his manager, this man spent 15 minutes inspecting both my rings... I was like OMG please DON'T test the eternity band... OMG I was like why is he taking so long. Now mind you, this jewelry store has an open area of where the Goldsmith sits and you could see him working. This man gave the NYC Sterling ring am overhaul on the prongs...I could see the difference. He even complimented the ring, how nice the \"diamonds\" are... This man was wearing loops... Go figure. He cleaned both rings and they sparkled like no bodies business. So NYC Sterling, your product is on point. Thank you. I'll continue to buy from you as well. I have no issues with your rings. No tarnishing, no green fingers, no stones coming out, well one time I did, you replaced the ring, again, thank you. So ladies, for the price... What do you have to fear... Absolutely NOTHING."

The problem was that 33 was a bit large on me, im usually somewhere between a 32-33. So i chose to get another pair, 32x30. I could barely even zip these pants up. Then I measured the \"rise\" of the pants, and i discovered that they took a whole inch away in the 32! So the 33 pants have a rise of 12.5\". Plenty of room, and they're great if you like to wear your pants at your waist instead of your hips. The 32 pants have a rise of only 11.5\". This is why i cant even pull them all the way up. the crotch is tiny. I have no clue what the rise would be if you bought a 34 or 36 or any other size really. but hope this will help someone"

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 14, 2010",
      "text": "I was in the market for a good, strong, hiking and trail pant. Most of the options I came across were too heavy, not durable enough, or didn't have the right pockets. I research, but rarely purchase, clothing online, but these weren't on any shelves in my area so I took the risk and ordered a pair through Amazon, thanks to a \"no-fee\" return offer on them at the time. Though that guarantee turned out to be a bit of a hassle I was very pleased with the purchase and ended up with three pairs, one of each color. Here is my overall analysis: Pros: 1) The pants are lighter and more breathable than I expected. I have other double-knee pants; they are quite heavy. However, these are made of a durable but lightweight cotton weave that breathes very well. Considering all of the extra pockets and associated material (including Cordura-lined back pockets) I was shocked at how light the pants were. They represent the pants as being rip resistant (\"Ripstop\" as they say) and while I haven't seen them handle a rip, I am inclined to believe their claim. The particular weave of the cotton suggests that they would be hard to tear. 2) Good pockets and belt loops. The pockets are strong, well-stitched, and located in the right places. The front hip pockets are deep and made of very strong cotton. Not the thin white cotton found in jeans, these are almost canvas-like; very reliable. As I said above, the rear pockets have thick Cordura on the inside as the lining. I am confident that my shop pencil or combination square will not easily rip through as it has with my work jeans. The cargo pockets only have fullness on the rear seam, which is smart (the front seam lies flat, which prevents brush from catching easily while on the trail). They area large enough and close with durable snaps that can be opened one-handed, but don't pop open on their own. No buttons to fumble with or weak velcro patches. There is also a cell phone pocket (maybe a little small for some), an exterior \"pliers\" cargo pocket, and a hammer loop; all on the right side, so Southpaws beware. The \"patented tape measure patch\" is kind of a gimmick as it isn't very thick leather and doesn't actually run on the inside of the pocket at all, which is where my tape always grabs and pulls. It covers the outside and the fold at the top of the pocket, but that's it. It's not bad, just doesn't really solve the tape pinching \"dilemma.\" The seven decent belt loops (including an extra wide center loop in the back) are well-spaced and provide good support and allow ample space for useful additions like binoculars, a flashlight, or a knife (yes, even a belt holster for those who are so inclined). 3) Serious stitching All of the major seams are triple stitched. All of the secondary ones are double and pretty serious. Most of the single-stitched are not high tension seams (just fullness and folds it seems) and look sturdy. Also the thread is of good quality. See \"Cons\" below for a side note. 4) Relatively Reasonable Price I paid [...] per pair (w/ free shipping and return shipping) on Amazon. Wrangler would sell direct at a little cheaper ($37 each I think) with free shipping on orders over $100. But of course, the return shipping would've been on me. So I went with Amazon. That's cheaper than Carhartts and these pants are lighter, have better pockets, and are better for hiking. However, I recently found these on a shelf at our local hardware mega-center (Menard's, for those who know it) at around $30 per pair. That's a screaming deal. So look for them. You might be able to find a local retailer by going to [...]. Cons: 1) Be aware - Waist measurements seem to be on the low side. I was thankful for the free return shipping deal, since the pants seem to run on the small side for their waist measurements. All of my other pants are 33s, but for these I needed a 34 to feel comfortable. And no, it wasn't merely wishful thinking on my part, the pants really do run tight in the waist. 2) Made in Mexico If you're a \"Made in the USA\" person, these won't fulfill that criteria. But judging by the quality, Wrangler made it clear they wanted good workmanship. If you're simply sick of substandard products from overseas, especially China, these aren't that. Not even close. 3) A couple of single-stitch runs might not hold up. Here and there, I have found a few stitching errors. Thread tails, needle burps, even one unfinished end. But all of them were in non-critical places. All in all, on three pairs I found 5 or 6 errors TOTAL. I don't know if you can do better than that for assembly-line clothing. 4) The free return shipping required a call to Amazon...twice. Despite the \"automatic\" nature of the free return shipping offer from Amazon, both of the pairs that I returned resulted in a return shipping charge on the return amount. This required a call to an Amazon Support rep both times to have return shipping refunded to me as well. The reps were friendly, quick to reverse it, and noted that the return should have been automatic. But since it wasn't twice, it was obviously not something they were going to fix. Realizing that this is not really relevant to the product itself, i did not figure in this factor when giving the four star rating. Nonetheless, you should know it for your own decision. Overall, very pleased with the purchase. Good, sturdy pants with nice features at a competitive price. They aren't Carhartts, but I didn't really want Carhartts or to pay Crahartt prices . I wish I had waited and bought it locally for the reduced price, but at the time this was as good a deal as I could find."

The double fabric on the knees makes them last longer. The quality is good overall. CONS: The inseam measurement is often longer than advertised, and I often have to hem them. I currently have several pairs of 30\" inseam non-insulated pants that measured between 30.5\" and 31.5\" when purchased. Having to hem them all the time is a hassle. The only other negative thing I can say about them is that they always wear out in the crotch area. This area needs to be better reinforced (see photo). It is the Achilles heel of these pants."

The QC seems to be a lower standard on this pair, if I am to assume that they are genuine Wrangler's. Alignment of the 2 rear pockets is not the same as my other pairs, and actually not the same as each other. The Cordura rear pocket lining has a different stitching line and less material used for the wrap-around excess. The colour of the Cordura is also noticeably more brown than the more green/brown of the other pairs. Genuine Cordura? The side cargo pockets have less material used in the expansion layer and therefore won't expand as much when being filled as my other pairs. I paid significantly less for this pair, £20 compared to around £40-£50 for the others I have. It may be that there are other corners that have been cut in the manufacturing of this pair that I have not yet noticed. All of these points were identified in 10 minutes after opening the package, which I don't believe to necessarily be the original packaging, and it should also be noted that all the tags and store sale labels were already removed. In all, it does seem that there's a reason for this particular pair to be sold at such a discount compared to the Nicaraguan made pairs I have. I just hope that the bad QC doesn't extend to such things as thread quality and other things that are not so easily detected."

      "text": "These soft nursing tops are my favorite shirts to wear out in public and around the house. They are roomy enough that I wore them at the end of my pregnancy, when my other maternity shirts were getting too tight. They are flattering, but best of all very modest. When my baby is hungry I don't feel self conscious or feel the need for an additional cover while nursing around other people. They open up to where I can reveal just enough breast for baby to nurse, but don't expose my whole chest like many other nursing tops. They are also great for pumping. They open up wide when needed so I can easily attach my pump to both breasts. I have worn these the last 7 months. They have held up in the wash beautifully, no tearing or fading and they are still super soft. Don't forget them in the dryer or in a laundry basket, because they do tend to wrinkle a little. Even if they are wrinkled once I wear them for a while the wrinkles tend to go away. I like these so much I even wear them to work. My mom bought me more in different colors because they are flatering and functional. If you are breastfeeding or plan to, get these shirts!"

The only two things I dislike is that this material shows water stains easily which is a huge deal for me.... And the fit is more fitted than loose like I anticipated due to the photos (but I am chunky so that's probably just my sizing error lol) I'd recommend these anyway though! If you're careful you can avoid water stains (unless baby drools on you like mine did lol) and the fit could be better if you're leaner. 🙂"

The heavier material also hid nipples better and any leaks."

The material is pretty thin which is great in the summer, you won't overheat while nursing your baby, however they will show any and all belly flab so I don't think they're particularly flattering to wear.

I had a C-section so I ordered up a size so they would be loose and I’m so glad I did because they do fit just a little snug for women with broader shoulders. My little one does not like to be covered up so these were amazing because I could nurse him but still be slightly covered and not be completely exposed. I wish they had a few more solid color choices but overall amazing."

It hasn't helped that I'm stuck in a chair nursing all day and night with hardly any time to shower. My nursing tops we're even feeling gross. When my husband ordered these for me, I couldn't believe the feel of them! They feel so soft and clean and actually make me feel good about myself again! There is only one downside to the sizing in that it fits right on the belly which isn't great postpartum, and it fits loose on the bust because of the way the part that under part is. Definitely order your regular size but be prepared for the top to be a bit loose and bottom a bit tighter at first. Love this product! These are the only nursing shirts I will now be buying!!! Thanks for making me feel good again!"

Also, wearing them with bare feet, the fur felt prickly which would have been the plant based silicate included within the sheep fur. After a day of wearing though, these have turned into the most comfortable slippers I have ever owned! The stiffness has gone and they feel snuggly rather than tight. The prickly feeling has gone and the fur is cosy and warm. Be assured, these are genuine Uggs and I would be happy to recommend them."

However, a couple loose threads at the bottom of the jeans make me worry about the longevity. DETAILED REVIEW: The Good: Shipment: The jeans arrived in a neat, undamaged box, with accurate shipping time. Fit: The jeans fit exactly as expected based on typical jeans sizing, for me. I got a 30x30 in the “Bastion” color – highly recommend the color for a classy casual look. Value: At this price point, this jeans are a steal. Watch out for intermittent price drops that make these jeans unbeatable. The Bad: Loose threads in the seam: After a couple uses, I noticed a couple loose threads in the seam of the jeans. I worry about the longevity but hope that a couple threads won’t cause an issue. Lint Attraction: A dog owner, this jeans do unfortunately catch a lot of dog hairs and lint. Not a total dealbreaker, but something to keep in mind."

Which I have... Until I get a compliment! Haha! (4) They’re a couple dollars cheaper than what you’d pay in Target, so that is always a win! Things to dislike... (1) If you’re like me, little things might make you OCD... The “finish”/“stain” color of the top disc of the earrings and the bottom are slightly different, and sometimes that can get under my skin and cause me not to wear them with an outfit that feels too “perfect”/“just so” or “untextured” for them. Bottom line: if these ever go missing for some reason, I will be purchasing them again! SUPER CUTE."

It has that kind of \"foggy day in London\" look, yet is light enough that you don't regret wearing it when the clouds clear. There are lots of pockets which are cut so that they can hold a large cell phone, yet they aren't baggy enough to mess with the looks (ie, you don't look like you've just jumped out of a plane, or are trying to smuggle drugs through a border). As a person that likes the look of winter clothes, yet lives in a place where you could wear board shorts in the winter, I'm pretty happy with this purchase."

      "text": "The material seems to be the same as what they use for those disposable hazmat suits. In fact, I would say the product was designed to be used a few times and thrown away, not something that will last more than a year. The fit is kind of funky also, because it rides way up on the crotch though the legs are too long, and overall is ballonish and much bigger than anyone could ever need, unless you are severely overweight. The suspenders aren't anything too special, and the zippers are cheap and won't last long either, as far as I can tell. Compared to my Helly Hansens I was trying to replace, the difference in quality is noticeable, and though these may be a lot cheaper, I wouldn't trust them in the woods. They make noise so they really aren't good for hunting, but I suppose if someone's on a tight budget and doesn't need them for more than once or twice a year they would be OK. I'm sending them back and spending more to get better quality and fit. These are OK and might be useful for a certain kind of buyer, but I'm the kind of person who doesn't mind paying for quality outdoors equipment."

      "text": "I'm 5'6\" and wear 30\" inseam pants. I read the other reviews and decided to play it safe and just order a size small. I wanted to make sure that when I tried them on that I didn't end up swimming in them. Anyway, I Just unpacked them and tried them on over my clothes. First impressions. High crotch, length is perfect! I'm not stepping on the cuffs. Just loose enough for layering. The shoulder straps are elastic and adjustable. I make them as long as possible and the crotch issue is resolved. They float real nice on me. If you're taller than 5'6\" you can't wear size small. You'd have to modify the shoulder strap length. Next is the flexibility test because I don't wanna rip out the crotch. I drop into a squat and they slide real nice over my clothes. They do stretch snug over the top of the thighs though, but loose everywhere else. The crotch seems pretty well constructed. Next I step one leg up on a chair and do a deep runner stretch with the other leg as far back as possible. No problems at all and crotch isn't stressed. I would like them to be just a \"little\" more baggy so they don't stretch snug over the top of the thighs while squatting, but I refuse to lose how well they fit everywhere else. Now the zippers. For me, the chest zipper goes low enough so I can use the head. Something I was expecting not to have, so that's a great bonus. The leg zippers are more than high enough for access but the adjustment straps pull from the side to the front. Shouldn't they pull from the side/front to the back? The result is this weird scoop ends up on the sides. Not very streamlined. No matter, I'll remove it myself and put it where I want it. They fit perfect enough to keep. If I somehow end up ripping the crotch out there's no way I would ever need to replace them with anything larger than a medium. In fact from what I gather from the other reviewers I would be swimming in them. I'm dinging one star for the lack of chest pockets (zippered ones would be perfect) and the lack of hand pockets as well (zippered ones would be good there as well). I'll update after I put them through their paces. I'm still waiting for my jacket to show up."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 7, 2019",
      "text": "Performance: I bought these to see if I could use them with my motorcycle commutes when it got wet outside. I like the bib in combo with my motorcycle rain jacket. Unfortunately, even just in mist/fog type moisture, these pants will seep in the crotch. Everything else is fine. I'm sure it's just that the seems aren't meant to be tested while under the stress of sitting on a motorcycle. If I just stand up and let someone spray me with a water hose, everything repels water fine. Construction: The material is extremely lightweight and tougher than it appears. It's not that easy to rip this material. The seams don't have any visible defects that would allow them to leak which is why I'm sure they work perfectly when not under stress. Under extreme heat, like an exhaust pipe, they will melt fast. Keep them away from a strong heat source. Conclusion: I'm 5'10\" 200 lbs and I bought them to go over a bunch of riding gear so I bought an XL, I could have easily gotten away with a L. These sizes are already set up to account for going over a layer of clothing. If you want to stay dry while walking around, these will work beautifully. If you want to stay dry while riding a motorcycle, they will get your crotch wet after about 20 mins; everything else will be dry."

The one problem I have with them is that the solid color one (not the ones with prints) tend to get linty and fibers stick to the material. I've tried lint rolling and they don't come off. Otherwise this is such a good product."

The grip on the bottom is too soft and quickly got torn up by my pedal pins. Now the bottom is a shredded mess and the grip is not great. I'm riding 2-3 times per week and the bottom was destroyed within just a few months. These are probably great for an occasional or very recreational rider but I will be upgrading to five ten freeriders."

These Giro shoes have a Vibram sole that I thought would last a long time. It didn't. My pedals are chewing through these shoes fast. I'm pretty disappointed in this purchase. These weren't cheap and don't work better than my skate board shoes. They are not comfortable as they run narrow for a regular size shoe.

Every other pair of jeans and trousers I have put on in the past 10 years have not fit, or have to be in a larger size and don't fit in the waist. I still cannot put on any other brand of jeans and have them fit me. The NYDJ Marilyn Straight - are about as perfect as a pair of jeans can get. can get. These are wonderful - they are a tiny smidge too big in the waist - but that is because I have always had an abnormally small waist to hip and breast ratio. And I've discovered that jeans button pins make the waist adjustable, so that takes care of the waist issue. I live in these!"

Though the 30\" inseam is long, I will have to get them tailored. The Black Dmn was a bit snug; I will have to get them tailored. My question is, has this occurred to others who have purchased the same style of jeans [Marilyn style], but the two different colors fit differently? I would love your thoughts and suggestions.

      "text": "First off, I am a huge fan of Citizen Eco-Drive watches. I bought my first one in 2010 and it's still running to this day. I stopped using that one daily after the band broke down on me and I haven't gotten around to replacing it. Fast forward to 2022 and I'm in need of another solid watch. I had been using an older Casio G-Shock after joining the military, but that started dying on me and the display only got more faint as time went on even after battery replacement. Then I got a cheaper Timex watch and the timing on it started to fall way behind after only about a month of use, up to an hour behind at times. I had enough, so I looked at getting a new Citizen Eco-Drive watch. One that matched my uniform which is what I wear most of the week. I needed a watch that was easy to read at a glance, reliable, rugged enough for work, and accurate. This watch hits all those marks. I haven't had a single problem with it since purchasing it and I've already taken it all over the place. The only 2 downsides I can think of are: 1. The band it comes with isn't the greatest. It's definitely TOUGH, but it's a bit too stiff and a bit too short if you have larger wrists. I wouldn't say I do and it was still not an easy fit. I replaced the band with a Supreme NATO strap from Crown & Buckle. 20mm band/strap fits the watch fine in my eyes regardless of what the specs say. 2. The hands don't glow as much as I'd like in the dark. Night shifts or later shifts can be rough when you're away from any lighting. Don't get me wrong, I can make out the time, but it takes longer than I'd like to because the hands aren't as bright. The only feature I miss from my G-Shock is the light up function. But overall, I'd trade that for not having to replace batteries ever again any day of the week. And I don't usually work nights or away from lighting, so it's something I can deal with. In the end, if these features seem to suit you and your needs, definitely recommend this watch!"

I’m a guy of, let’s say, larger carriage. My wrists are big but I’ve never had an issue with a watch fitting. This one? Not even close to wearable. I spent a full minute struggling to get the last hole to buckle. When it did I couldn’t move my hand.

Other than the band, I highly recommend this watch."

      "text": "I love Citizen watches. They have given me good quality and consistency through a lot of hard wear and use outside. Bonus, I never have to change the battery. I've had my eye on this one for quite a few years. I dont recall when I first saw it, but it was around 2016. It arrived Saturday, the box was damaged. It had pretty clearly been opened before, the watch had a home once already. But it looked good and undamaged and started working immediately. The first negative I noticed is that the watch band is laughably narrow. It looks like they swapped bands with a woman's watch. Fine if thats your thing, but I really did not care for tge proportions. The next thing I noticed is how thick and stiff the band is. I dont know how many layers of Cordura they sewed together, but it is puffy in the middle, which is odd geometry to put on a watch band because you create pressure points on the wrist. The band sucks. It is ugly because it is so narrow, it is very difficult to manipulate because it is so stiff, and it is incredibly uncomfortable. Both my previous citizens also got low marks for band quality, so its not really a deal breaker for me, but boy is it ever irritating to spend $180 on a watch that you can't wear out of the box. For the price of a good looking replacement band, I could have just gotten a Timex. My solution was to make a crude frog that slips under the band. It takes the pressure off my skin, and it makes the band appear thicker. I'm not kidding when I say, if you buy this watch, buy a new band at the same time."

These boots are darling, are easy to get on and off, are great for trudging through snow/slush/rain. But there are a few things that I think they could’ve done better. There’s a flap behind the heel/back of the ankle that doesn’t stay down and rides up (see photo). This isn’t great for walking as it bunches up behind my heel/ankle - kinda annoying. Another thing is that there’s a section where the sole joins with the upper rubber that seems to not be fully joined/glued and might separate with more use. They’re still great casual boots that look good on!"

      "text": "I really like the quality of the hat. My only gripe is, when I measured my head, it was at 22.5\", so I ordered the L-XL expecting it would fit without needing to stretch. However, there is a snug fit to the hat and I can feel it stretch when I put it on, which grows uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing it. I wore it for several days (pretty much all day) and it ended up producing a sore and scab on my forehead. I guess I just have a huge head. I plan to try the XL-XXL size to see if that's a better fit for all-day use. I plan to keep this hat though. The snug fit is exactly what I want for long-boarding, boating, etc when you don't want the thing blowing off your head."

I am large (5'7\", 265 lbs) and the 3x-5x fit me very easily---not at all constricting, and a few are even a bit baggy. I wear predominantly black, navy, brown and even one pair of purple, so i can't speak to the see-through-ness of lighter colors, but the dark colors are not at all see-through. It is the same fabric content as LulaRoe leggings, and i've had zero fading or bleeding on any of them. I wash them on cold, on the delicate cycle, and hang to dry. The few times i've had to machine-dry them, they come out fine. I just hang them because i think it will add to the life of the fabric. with as many pairs of these i've bought, only ONE has gotten a small hole in the crotch. I've been buying them for at least five years, and seldom throw anything away, so that means i'm going on five years with some of these pants. Yes, i have a bunch so i don't have to wash a few loads for a couple weeks at a time (or longer), which also adds to the life, but i'm totally satisfied with the quality and durability of these capris/pants. as some have stated, the ankle-length pants do run long, so you might have a little scrunching-up at the ankles, but better than too short, IMO. I have recommended these to everyone i know (especially when you couldn't get solid leggings from LulaRoe very often, or for half the price). the leggings from Roaman's, et al, have a high cotton content, and start fading from the first wash, and they bag and sag after a few hours. These have not faded at all. i don't know what i'm gonna do when they stop making tunic tops long enough to cover my fat butt, and when this store stops making stretchy pants. I've gotten so spoiled by their comfort and elasticity."

      "text": "These are by far the best leggings I've ever got. I've bought several pairs in black in both the 3x-5x and most recently the 1x-3x as I've lost weight. They are both great. They're true to size, they last, they're comfy, they're not see through at all, they stay pretty black even after washing (I'll get into that), they're amazing for us tall girls (I'm 5'11), which I thought would be the most helpful for any of my fellow tall girls. They are true ankle length and don't shrink to your calves when dried in the dryer. Love love love them. With all of that said though...The black ones NEED to be washed several times or your skin and everything you sit on WILL be dyed purple. I make what I call \"new legging tea\" in the sink. Hot hot water plus dish soap. Dish soap is important bc it draws the dye out best. I rinse and repeat this process three times then wash twice regularly. Yes it is a hassle. But if you're as sick and tired as I was of trying to find leggings as a tall, (former) big girl then it's worth it. I gave the leggings four stars because if the dye didn't leech they'd 100% deserve 5 stars. I hope this helps someone else to not have permanent purple butt prints on their white leather dining chairs and toilet seats."

I am 5ft 3 and my daughter who is 5ft 8 with fuller hips, tried mine on and they fit her perfectly. She is ordering some right now. They are incredibly soft with amazing stretch but they don't lose their fit after washing and retain elasticity and softness. So, so comfortable; I am trying to restrain myself from buying one in every color. LOL."

      "text": "This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don’t leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium weight fabric — not as light and stretchy as Nike’s “dry miler” running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running. The material is a little weird because it doesn’t really stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn’t seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it’s just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I actually am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric — because it doesn’t really stretch I couldn’t really roll up/push up the sleeves. Not really a huge deal except I’m used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn’t work. Overall good for what I needed it for. I wouldn’t spend a ton of money for it but I personally plan to keep an eye out and will buy more in other colors if and when the prices randomly drop like they sometimes do on here :)"

He normally wears a large in shirts (6'0 and 150 pounds) but based on the size chart, I got him a medium. The medium fit great and not too tight or too baggy. The costume is well made for $30. You get the jacket, sash, and belt. The gloves and pants aren't included. I was amazed that the buttons are actual buttons, not velcroed like most costumes. For the sash, you need to lift the shoulder cap, put on the sash, then velcro the cap back down. The belt was kind of loose in the back, but we can pin it. Very happy with this costume!"

If not pop down to your local charity shop and pick up the shirt and pants to go with it. That’s all you will need because everything else is there, the belt and sash are so nice. Will definitely look very dapper and handsome in this. I added an extra pin and some long gold like chains that I got from the dollar store.

After scrolling and scrolling, we happened upon this dress. Liked it, ordered it, BOOM! Perfect bridesmaid dress! It is very flowy. I did have to get mine hemmed, but that's normal for me, I'm very short. Dude! The top part is also a little sexy without being too sexy. It's very comfy. I definitely plan on wearing this for more events after my sister's wedding."

It doesn't cover as a normal roomy hood does. The jacket fits just at the hip so if you have a lower belly bulge go one or two sizes up. I bought the 2x and it fits like an XL. That's why I wonder if it is authentic. It fits like Asian sizes. I wanted a closer fit but it could be longer. It seems like it's 23-24 inches instead of 26-28 inches long like a usual plus size hoodie."

My forearms aren't very big compared to the rest of me, but the sleeves are definitely a little tight. I do reccomend sizing up but otherwise it is a nice hoodie and I quite enjoy the fit otherwise."

This top was actually larger in the length of the straps and waist (as a 34D,36D) I was expecting this to be too small however it appeared to fit perfectly while and if only when I stood still. As I turned to the side I realized what was not feeling (fabric) was total side boob. Half of the side (nipple was covered) but half of the other half of my breast was fully exposed, on each side. So long story short. Perfect for smaller chest bc it’s going to be too loose to size up with no support and not fully cover the chest, in a flattering way. But the material and design is great. Exactly as it looks in the pics. Minus the person wearing it."

It’s the perfect mom bathing suit that doesn’t scream “mom bathing suit”, but you can wear it to the beach or a pool without feeling over exposed. Not to mention it’s cute! So for that, I love it. But.. the padding in the top is really weird. I don’t remember the one I bought last year being like this, but it’s the first thing I noticed this time around. I’m not sure if it’s because I’m larger up top? I’m a 36DD, but I can’t imagine the padding being in the “right spot” for anyone. I don’t know. It’s weird. Maybe there’s an easy fix to it, but I sure can’t figure it out. So far it’s been a whole lot of adjusting!"

While the shoulders, chest and arms fit comfortably the collar is gaping, and the lapels have a tendency to curl up substantially. I bought several of these in solid colors that hang in the closet of my home office. I essentially wear one most work days on Zoom rather than using nicer quality polos for work tasks. The problem I just identified was that the shirt was accidentally dried in a hot dryer with other colors such as boxer shorts and socks. It shrank quite a bit, and I would estimate it's actually closer to a slim fit now. Unfortunately the vertical shrinking was immense and now barely hangs below my belt line."

I am pleased to report that these are among the better polos I have owned. I'm 5'10\", 120lbs, very skinny build, so it can be difficult to find shirts that are slim enough without being too short. These polos in a size small are a perfect fit. The small size is similar in length to a typical medium t-shirt. They might be a little long for shorter people. I have not experienced any shrinkage in the wash (either cold or medium) or after drying. The material feels as good as almost any polo, breathable but not too thin. The collar is wide enough to be worn buttoned all the way up for that nerdy look. I was happy enough with these shirts that I quickly ordered 3 more."

However, I followed the advice of Amazon and other reviewers and ordered a size down but the Small was far too tight. Measured across the chest below the arms on one side, the garment was about 50cm (100cm all round), which is about right for a Small in my view. I should have ordered my normal size according to the Amazon size guide. I used to buy my polos from a large UK highstreet retailer but recently their shirts have become lower quality and are now made of a thinner fabric so I looked for an alternative. These Amazon shirts in comparison are slightly less expensive, better quality and made from thicker, heavier, slightly coarser fabric. If, like me, you're looking for simple, pure cotton polos without brand logos (and the associated cost) but better quality than those from budget retailers, these Amazon shirts might be for you. I just wish they'd restock and offer a wider range of colours. Amazon delivery and the handling of my return was prompt and hassle-free."

  "description": "Product Description Edox has produced Watches Since 1884, leading-technology high-precision timepieces with passion, ingenuity and a meticulous attention to details. In 1883, Christian Ruefli-Flury, an exceptionally gifted watchmaker, gave his wife, Eva-Maria, a pocket watch he designed for her 25th birthday. She was so impressed with her husband's talents and the beauty of the watch that she persuaded him to found his own watchmaking company. Christian Ruefli-Flury launched his watchmaking enterprise in Biel-Bienne. He named the company \"Edox,\" which means the hour in ancient Greek. The hourglass logo he put on his watches has adorned all Edox watches ever since. For a century and a quarter, the history of Edox has been studded with horologic successes and inventions of which many remain unrivaled to this day. EDOX LES BÉMONTS COLLECTION Les Bémonts is a pictoresque forest situated just a few meters from the EDOX factory. The timepiece collection features classical design, with pure and timeless lines and is equipped with a variety of high-quality Swiss-made movements, from the automatic chronograph to the Ultra Slim quartz movement.

Their polarizing effect is the only thing that works for my very light sensitive eyes. I need them especially for driving. They've been through the gauntlet, and almost look new. The lack of pins is probably my favorite feature, given that my children love trying to snap the arms off. I've lost the arms multiple times, and have always been able to pop them back on with no problems. These sunglasses have virtually no scratches or signs of wear despite being used many times a week in various harsh weather conditions. Just ordered another pair in a different color."

      "text": "I bought these for my husband about 4 years ago. I am now buying him a second pair because these are literally the only shoes he wears to work and his are stained and worn thin. My husband is the pickiest person to buy shoes for and it has caused a lot of stress over the years. He is also a physician and spends a lot of time on his feet, so they have to be the most comfortable shoes to ever exist for him to like them otherwise I will never hear the end of it. The first weekend he had these, he wore them to a conference and to all the social events afterwards, walking several miles between establishments in Miami. He said 13hrs was probably stretching the time his feet were comfortable for the first time wearing them, but fair. I did change out the laces for elastic shoelaces because he said it took “too long to tie them.” Coming from a man that has nothing but complaints about every single shoe ever, that’s an easy fix. He is usually an 11.5 and has these in an 11. He has a narrower foot, so the width has not been an issue."

I was not planning to buy another pair of dress shoes until a couple of weeks ago I was sitting on the train and I realized BOTH of my shoes were ripped and I could basically see my socks. I realized it was time to stop buying cheap shoes and invest in some nice shoes. Since I already have 4 pairs of Cole Haan's I thought why not get another? These shoes are great!! They are very comfortable and do a pretty good job at keeping the water out. I was walking in the rain yesterday and my sock did not get wet. I love the black and white style as well!"

Thinking this was a bit off I decided to return it but I have since learned this is standard procedure for spinnaker. I also discovered that by going direct to you can take advantage of sales and discount codes which typically bring the price of this down to £180. I managed to get the bracelet version for just over £200 which is nearer to what I would want to pay for one of these. See my full review of the watch under the black dial bracelet version."

      "text": "The watch is decent but not remarkable. However, it's severely let down by the thin and poor-quality spring bars. Upon trying to change the strap, my spring bar tool snapped the end of one of the spring bars which means it's now impossible to fit a strap due to the tiny end piece being stuck in the hole. I should add, I've changed straps on watches using a spring bar tool hundreds of times and never experienced this. So, sadly, it's been consigned to a shoebox with the other watches I no longer wear."

      "text": "Ich sammle gerne Uhren und habe schon eine kleine Sammlung. Somit kann ich die Uhr gut vergleichen. Dies ist meine erste Uhr jedoch von spinnaker. Nach unzähligen Videos auf YouTube habe ich mich gefreut die Uhr zu bestellen. Dank Prime ist sie natürlich schnell bei mir angekommen. Was erhalten wir für 300€: Saphirglas mit ir coating, NH 35 Uhrwerk, biderektionale Lünette welche unterm Glas sitzt, solides Armband, superluminova usw. Also eigentlich recht viel...aber nur eigentlich. Die Dicke der Uhr mit 1,5cm kommt auf den Bildern nicht gut rüber. Für kleine Handgelenke ist die Uhr leider nicht geeignet...das Armband hilft der Uhr auch nicht um schmaler zu wirken. Trotz der tollen Verarbeitung und des wunderschönen Zifferblattes, welches eine Struktur vorweist, habe ich die Uhr zurückgeschickt. Der stärkste Konkurrent der Uhr ist die Seiko selbst. Ich spreche hier nicht von Design sondern von den Daten und dem Preis. Es wird schwer sein Seiko Fans von dieser Uhr zu begeistern wenn sie im selben Preissegment liegt. Für breitere Arme ist die Uhr definitiv geeignet und kann ihre Schönheit entfalten. Kleinere Arme hingegen lassen die Uhr klobig aussehen. Wurde der Preis auf 250-270€ fallen dann wäre spinnaker sicherlich eine interessante Alternative zu Seiko."

The price is reasonable and the quality is quite good. Unfortunately, they are not made of the \"no iron required\" cotton fabric, but really no big deal. Ironing is an underrated form of exercise and with a little spray starch, look crisp and pulled together."

I'm 5 ft 0 and 157lbs with a long torso, chest is 36D waist 34 hips probably 42 or something (big hips). I bought a Large. I wouldn't say this shirt was too tight anywhere. The shoulders fit decently. I definitely want to wash before the first wear due to fold creases and the collar being a little stiff. This is not as good quality as my wrinkle-free broadcloth oxford from lands end, that's for sure. But it's a good casual stand-in. Definitely wouldn't consider it work wear unless you have a casual job. The cotton isn't super soft or smooth. The side seams aren't hidden. They're quite wide and stand out awkwardly. Overall this is a good budget buy for a SAHM like myself who just wants a casual , basic wardrobe staple."

      "text": "The media could not be loaded. The fabric for the shirt is 100% cotton and good quality. I washed my white shirt in hot water and ran it through the dryer at medium. I found shrinkage to be minimal. The shirt is 100% cotton and definitely will have to be ironed. If you don’t like to iron, this shirt is not for you. Some have commented that it does not iron easily but I did not find that to be true. You simply need to have your iron on the hot/cotton setting and be sure to use steam. I am 5‘1“ and on the heavier side with a 41 inch bust. I had to size up to a large-I generally wear a medium- But this gets the job done for me though I will either safety pin or add a snap to prevent gapping when I move. For most however I think you will find it to be adequate around the bust line and generous to the waist and hips. The length works for me, and though the sleeves are too long I generally roll them up so that is not a problem for me. After washing and running through the dryer, the sleeve length as measured from the underarm to the edge of the cuff is approximately 18 inches. The center back, measured from the bottom of the collar to the bottom of the shirt is approximately 27 1/2 inches. For the money, this is a great classic piece which I believe I will get a lot of value for the money."

I ended up measuring the 2 chains and it turned out that the first chain, the one I thought was 20\" was actually 22\" A 20\" inch chain would have been perfect and I returned the 18\" I wasn't ready to try again so I'm living with the 22\" chain.

The only draw back I may have is that after about 4 weeks of wearing them, several times a week, the leather has relaxed.

Fit and finish of the product is top notch. Durable, will last 5+ years with everyday use and longer with infrequent use. No sewing errors or \"oddball\" issues. Predictable fit that once you know what works for you will be consistent and trouble-free. All in all, worth your money and even better value when on sale, as during the holidays."

Unfortunately, they have a big hole in the cloth after seven months of occasional use. I've probably worn them a total of 25 times, which for me for a $130 shoe is not a great tradeoff.

However, I ordered a large and it was too tight around my chest area.....I have to return the top and they don't offer an XL at this time....so sad. I will keep looking out for this top in my size as I think it will be very body flattering had I ordered the bigger size. I had read reviews that this top ran big...but in my case it did not. Super pretty especially for the price."

Made to look like it's been around since 1988, not a cheap screen print job just how it should look. Which is exact to image shown for ordering. Sizing...runs small. The mens 2x fits just a bit looser then a large...person wears a men's large. The men's 3x fits like a men's 1x, and both are a bit short in length maybe a 28 inch from shoulder seam to hem. Zoo fits at natural waist for the bottom hem. Glad I bought the shirts knowing sizing is subjective. Doesn't detract from a cool pop culture shirt, just something to keep in mind and maybe order up a size. It be dating and don't you may get one that fits perfectly."

Because they lace in the front, I have the ability to loosen the laces to zip up the boots. I am also very picky about the soles of boots/shoes. I have neck and back issues... if the soles are stiff and have no support - they will not work for me. These have rubber soles with some arch support... I have worn these boots multiple times and have been extremely pleased. I love that they are insulted with fur from the toes to the top! Very warm. I did go up a half size because I like to wear thick socks in the winter, it was a good choice for me. One thing I do not like about the boots is that the ankle area is \"baggy\". But I deal with it because these boots have so many other positive aspects."

These boots are great! I have trouble finding a simple pair of non-high to low heeled high knee boots, that are simple yet cute and don't have a large leg opening. The heels aren't that bad, and the boots are spectacular. Definitely worth the money and fast shipping :)"

These boots have become my new fav to wear while walking the dog through the park, or to run errands. I’ve not used them in rain or snow, so idk how waterproof they are. But they keep my feet warm. I would size up if you want to wear thick socks."

  "description": "Product Description The Godfathers of the jam band world, Grateful Dead spread their one of kind musical style to millions of people around the globe over their 30-year career. The legendary band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California amid the rise of the counterculture of the 1960’s. Jerry Garcia on lead guitar/vocals, Bob Weir on rhythm guitar/vocals, Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan on keyboards/harmonica/vocals, Phil Lesh on bass/vocals, and Bill Kreutzmann on the drums were the founders of Grateful Dead, later joined by drummer Mickey Hart. McKernan died in 1973 due to health issues, but the rest of the core played together for the entire history of the band. Influenced by rock, country, folk, bluegrass, and blues, their psychedelic musical style did not fit an established genre. Grateful Dead first performed in 1965 at one of Ken Kesey’s Acid Tests in San Jose, California. Their first major performance followed in 1967 at the Mantra-Rock Dance, a musical event at the Avalon Ballroom that included acts Big Brother and the Holding Company and Janis Joplin. Grateful Dead has sold 35 million albums worldwide, but it was always about the live performance. They constantly toured and their live improvisations differentiated them from other bands, who would rehearse specific setlists. Garcia stated in a 1966 interview: \"We don't make up our sets beforehand. We'd rather work off the tops of our heads than off a piece of paper.” This created a unique experience every time they took the stage, for them and the audience. A world record, Grateful Dead played over 2,300 concerts and more free concerts than any other band in history. Initially, their live shows were primary in the San Francisco Bay Area, but they inevitably reached the rest of America as well as Canada, Europe, and even the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. They promoted a sense of community among their fans, and many would follow the band from venue to venue, spawning the birth of Deadheads. They were one of the first bands to allow fans to record their shows and trade them freely amongst each other. Impromptu communal marketplaces, known as Shakedown Street, were created by Deadheads at concert venues, allowing fans to buy and sell anything from food to home-made T-shirts while following the band. On August 9th, 1995, Jerry Garcia died from a heart attack after struggles with several health issues. The remaining members decided to disband, but there have been numerous reunions. Weir, Lesh, Kreutzmann, and Hart reunited in 2015 for five concerts called \"Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead.” Trey Anastasio of Phish joined them and the shows sold out stadiums in Chicago and Santa Clara. Weir, Hart, and Kreutzmann have teamed up John Mayer to keep the spirit alive today as Dead & Company. Grateful Dead was inducted to Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. Maybe the best way to sum up their legacy is to use a quote from Hart: “The transformative power of the Grateful Dead is really the essence of it; it's what it can do to your consciousness. We're more into transportation than we are into music, per se, I mean, the business of the Grateful Dead is transportation.” Lately, it occurs to me; What a long, strange trip it's been… Bertha Skull and Roses have been featured in Grateful Dead artwork throughout their career. Inspired by a drawing by Edmund Joseph Sullivan from the 1913 edition of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam , Alton Kelley and Stanley Mouse rendered the original draft, a skeleton with a crown of roses holding rose wreaths. The design first appeared on a poster in San Francisco for Dead shows at the Avalon Ballroom in 1966. It became famous when it was used as the cover for the untitled live album Grateful Dead (1971) . The album was published without a title after a dispute with the record company over the name, but became widely known as “Skull and Roses” because of the iconic cover art. The rose-wigged skeleton is often referred to as “Bertha,” the first track on the album. Dancing Bears The Dancing Bears made their artistic debut in 1973 as part of the album art for History of the Grateful Dead, Volume One – Bear's Choice. Drawn by Bob Thomas, the bears are a reference to Owsley “Bear” Stanley, the soundman for Grateful Dead and producer of the album. The bears are often referred to as the “Dancing” Bears, but they are actually marching. Bear himself has said: \"The bears on the album cover are not really 'dancing'. I don't know why people think they are; their positions are quite obviously those of a high-stepping march.” Whether they are dancing or marching, Deadheads fell in love with the colorful bears. They seem to represent what the culture is all about: Music, dancing, laughing, and marching arm in arm together showing solidarity as well as individuality. Steal Your Face The Skull and Lightning bolt emblem, originally created for a practical use, grew into one of Grateful Dead’s most recognizable symbols. The concept started with Owsley “Bear” Stanley when he was inspired by a freeway sign that stood out to him. He wanted to brand the group’s musical equipment so it could be easily identified during concerts with multiple bands. He shared the idea with artist Bob Thomas, and the first design was drafted in 1969. After some evolving, it contains a white skull (known as Stealie) and 13-point lightning bolt along with an alternating red and blue color scheme. Even though the symbol was used previously, it became known as the “Steal Your Face Skull” after it was featured on the cover of the album Steal Your Face . Dancing Terrapins Debuting in 1977, the Dancing Terrapins first appeared on the cover of Terrapin Station . Alton Kelley and Stanley Mouse collaborated again to develop the cover art. In the song, terrapin is referenced as a location: “Some rise; some fall; some climb; to get to terrapin.” The cover is more of a literal visualization of Terrapin Station, featuring two dancing terrapins playing banjo and tambourine next to railroad tracks. In many mythologies, turtles are associated with the cosmos and Earth, often depicted as supporting the world on his shell. The terrapins are a reminder of how lucky we are to be here and alive, showing that sometimes the best thing to do is to slow down, sing, dance, and enjoy the experience. Read more Woodstock '69 Woodstock is one of the most pivotal moments in rock and roll history. Attracting more than 400,000 music lovers, people from all over flooded to Bethel, New York in the summer of 1969 to celebrate peace and music over the 3-day party. The festival became a muddy mess with inadequate food, facilities and sanitation. Despite this, 32 acts performed including Jefferson Airplane, Jimi Hendrix, and Grateful Dead. The rain-soaked stage caused major problems for the band, as Grateful Dead members were being electrocuted by their instruments. Known as one of the best live bands of all time, this performance fell well short of expectations. Weir: “Some people made their careers at Woodstock, but we’ve spent about 20 years making up for it [laughs]. It was probably the worst set we’ve ever performed.” Festival Express '70 Originally called Trans Continental Pop Festival, the Festival Express left the station in the summer of 1970. The Canadian tour was headlined by Janis Joplin, The Band, and Grateful Dead playing in Toronto, Winnipeg, and Calgary. Instead of flying to each tour stop, the bands traveled by train leading to non-stop jam sessions and partying. They were met with protesters when arriving in Toronto due to high ticket prices, seen as promoter greed. Jerry Garcia quelled the crowd by arranging a free concert in nearby Coronation Park upon a flatbed truck. The tour was a financial failure, but it featured great performances. The tour was immortalized in the documentary Festival Express that premiered at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival. Cornell '77 While there will always be debate, the performance at Cornell University’s Barton Hall in Ithaca, New York on May 8th, 1977 is widely considered one of Grateful Dead’s best shows. The setlist is legendary, including standouts Scarlet Begonias -> Fire on the Mountain , where Phil Lesh’s bass melted faces during the opening riff and St. Stephen -> Not Fade Away -> St. Stephen . Only to be followed by a 14-minute version of Morning Dew , in which Garcia masterfully performed. One of the reasons this performance became so revered was the great sound quality of the tapes, recorded by Betty Cantor-Jackson. Original “Betty Boards” finally surfaced after a storage unit auction which included the famous Cornell recording. At last, Cornell 5/8/77 the live album was officially released on the show’s 40-year anniversary. Egypt '78 In the shadow of the Sphinx and Great Pyramid, Grateful Dead performed three shows in Giza, Egypt in September of 1978. Bassist Phil Lesh took the lead in planning the event along with band manager Richard Loren. Lesh wanted to play at a place of power: “Power that's been preserved from the ancient world.” There was some trouble staging the show, from an equipment truck getting stuck in sand and having to be towed out by camels to recording issues during the first show, but the wonder of the event offset any negative vibes. During the final show, a total lunar eclipse took place, really encapsulating the whole experience. In 2008, the band released Rocking the Cradle: Egypt 1978 , a live album composed of songs from nights two and three for the 30th anniversary of the event. Workingman's Dead Workingman’s Dead is the fourth studio album by Grateful Dead. Released in June of 1970, it was recorded back to back with companion album American Beauty . The majority of the album was written by Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter. They utilized an Americana, folk-band style that was different than the psychedelic, electrified tone of previous albums. According to drummer Bill Kreutzmann, the album was influenced by the Bakersfield sound, a genre of country music that was significantly influenced by rock and roll. Garcia had purchased a steel guitar while on tour the previous year and was keen on using it for this album. The album opens with the highly acclaimed Uncle John’s Band along with popular tracks Dire Wolf, Cumberland Blues, and Casey Jones. Rolling Stone readers voted it the best album of 1970. American Beauty American Beauty is the fifth Grateful Dead studio album. Released in November of 1970, it continued the bluegrass, folk-rock stylings of Workingman’s Dead that was released earlier in the year. Like Workingman’s Dead , most of the album was written by Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter. While recording the album at Wally Heider Studios in San Francisco, they were around Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young and other artists creating a “jammer heaven.” You can hear their influence on the band and album through folk melodies and vocal harmonization. The album title has a double meaning, referring to Americana style of music and the rose ‘American Beauty’ featured on its cover. Box of Rain opens side one, flowing right into Friend of the Devil , while side two starts with Ripple and finishes with Truckin’ . Europe '72 Europe ‘72 is a live triple album composed of songs recorded from Grateful Dead’s European tour in the spring of 1972 showcasing live favorites and new songs like Jack Straw and Brown Eyed Women . It was the last album to feature Ron “Pigpen” McKernan, one of the founding members, who died after its release. Originally recorded to recoup the expensive costs of the tour, it received commercial and critical success. Starting in London, the band made stops in Denmark, Germany, France, Netherlands, and Luxembourg, concluding the tour back in London. Their crew grew to 43 members who became known as the “Grateful Dead Family.” While it features songs from previous albums like Truckin’ and Sugar Magnolia , they are transformed into new performances with their improvisations. In the Dark After a 7-year hiatus from recording studio albums, Grateful Dead released their twelfth in July of 1987 with In the Dark . They had been playing the songs for several years prior to recording, allowing them to be matured and perfected. The band took a more comfortable approach when recording, playing in a darkened theatre with the same lighting they would use on tour, but with no audience. Reaching No. 6 on the Billboard 200 chart, it gained unexpected popularity and became the band’s only top ten album. It was led by the band’s only top 40 single, Touch of Grey , peaking at No. 9 as well as frequenting MTV with its music video. This mainstream success brought on a new set of fans referred to as “Touchheads.” This led to the “Mega-Dead” period where they began to sell out stadiums, a mixed blessing for some hardcore fans. Read more Fire on the Mountain Fire on the Mountain was composed by drummer Mickey Hart. An instrumental version titled Happiness is Drumming appeared in 1976 on the album Diga by Hart’s other band, Diga Rhythm Band. With lyrics written by Robert Hunter added, the song evolved into Fire on the Mountain . The song’s catchy rhythm was a perfect complement to Jerry Garcia’s playful guitar style. It was released on Grateful Dead’s Shakedown Street in November of 1978, even though the band was performing it live the year prior. It is often improvised and coupled with Scarlet Begonias during live shows, the pair being referred to as Scarlet Fire . The eternal partnership was immortalized by the 25-minute version performed at the famous Cornell University show on May 8th, 1977. Ripple “Ripple in still water; When there is no pebble tossed; Nor wind to blow.” Another successful collaboration between Robert Hunter and Jerry Garcia, Ripple was released on American Beauty in 1970. Garcia enlisted David Grisman to play mandolin on the track and Friend of the Devil from the same album. Fans have noted connections between the lyrics of Ripple and various religions and philosophies. Some lines are compared to Psalm 23 from the Bible, while the refrain has a Zen Kōan feel to it. Even the chorus is written in a haiku-esk format. No matter the interpretation, it always has a profound effect on the listener. Maybe so profound that two fans even start their own T-shirt company and pay tribute to inspirational track with the company name. Dark Star Dark Star started as an unassuming single released in 1968 that failed to sell 500 copies but became one of Grateful Dead’s most revered and mythical songs. The single was under 3 minutes long, much different than their live performances that could see Dark Star played for 20 to 30 minutes. Dark Star is the opening track on Live/Dead , the band’s first live album and is regarded as the very definition of the band’s early improvisational music with its blending of psychedelia, jazz, and jam elements. After 1973, the track fell out of regular rotation at their concerts. Catching a show that had a Dark Star performance became the “Holy Grail” for Deadheads. It is one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll as well as No. 57 on Rolling Stone’s 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time. Uncle John's Band The opening track of Workingman’s Dead , Uncle John’s Band is a bluegrass-folk arrangement with acoustic guitar and close harmony vocalization. Grateful Dead added the song to setlists in late 1969 and released it as a single prior to Workingman’s Dead . While the single did not garner huge success, it was the band’s first chart hit and attempt to reach mainstream audiences beyond their cult following. Though already an underground legend for their live shows, this was the first time many had heard the band. The identity of “Uncle John” has spawned many theories, from blues musician Mississippi John Hurt to John Cohen from the New Lost City Ramblers. Regardless of the inspiration, Uncles John’s Band is one of their most well-known songs and included on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. ",

Rating it 4 stars because it isn't the softest, but I have not washed it yet. I'll update the review accordingly when I wash. For reference, my husband is 2X and that is my preferred size for an oversized fit. This fit is true to size."

I bought a small in the other two and both fit perfectly. This didn't given any room to stretch. 2. The muxxn label isn't even in the dress. There's no label or tag or material etc. It's like someone put it together inn their garage because it doesn't even fit properly. It bunches where it should have been scrunched stylishly in the middle. 3. The original has a lining inside it so it has a better smooth appearance. Because this doesn't have that lining it's not very smooth when you put it on. This is a lovely dress from the real muxxn but not from this company"

I have paid twice as much when purchasing similar quality shirts from other retailers in the past. The version with chambray cloth seemed a little stiff and scratchy after just one wash, but the cloth used in the other two versions was soft from the get-go. My major complaint about the shirts is that Amazon cannot seem to keep all of the colors and sizes in stock. I would have purchased more of the shirts had they been available in my size in the color I preferred. It would also be nice if Amazon created a linen version of the shirt. In all of the versions, my experience is that you should order one size larger than your regular size."

Tried them on and didn't fit rigth either. The straps were kinda tight and the toe separater seemed misplaced for the size (making my heal stick off the end slighty). I was going to return them but I'm actually glad that I forgot to. I ended up wearing them out and about one day and they started to fit much better within minutes of walking in them. By the end of the day they were broken in and weren't tight across my foot anymore. Even my foot doesnt hang off!! (Somehow???) Lol also, they seem to be much better quality then I had initially thought too! I gave these 1 Star at first but have now changed them to 4 stars :) For refference: I'm a true 8 1/2 with average width. I bought a 9 and they JUST fit after breaking them in. Personally would like a LITTLE extra room at the heal part, (I like flip flops to be slightly bigger then my regular shoe size) and wish I would have bought a 9 1/2 now. Oh well though! They were cheap enough that I dont care that much that they aren't 100% perfect for me. BUUUUT, if they had slightly more room at the heal, I would have given 5 stars!"

However, the straps don't seem to have much \"give\" and they don't stretch at all. So that leaves marks on the top of your feet when worn for any amount of time. Not sure if that is a manufacturing defect or just this pair. Size is okay, maybe a little small."

They are thinner than you usually get in the UK, but for us that works out well as we use then under a 2.5 tog sleeping bag in a 19deg room. They are slim fitting, but despite having a chunky baby they fit well. Admittedly she's 80th centile, 15lb 10oz at 4 months and wearing 6-9 with sleeves and legs rolled up once, but then she's mostly in 6-9 from tesco/next etc anyway. A couple of things I personally think could be done better: * A double ended zip, so you can just open the bottom half for nappy changes, rather than exposing baby's whole body, especially for night time changes! * Fabric covering the inside face of the zip. Admittedly my baby hasn't had any problems or skin irritation with the zip on her skin, but I'd have expected to see it covered nonetheless"

Toddlers and stains go hand in hand. I love that it's a zip and the wee popper at the top. Don't think I would purchase them again though as they are very expensive for what you get.

I thought i had ordered a 12mo size. I check “my orders” list and it says i purchased 12-18 mo size! So while i still love the outfit and how he looks wearing it, he won’t be able to wear it as often as i had hoped. And I’m quite bummed. Because for 12-18 mo size, i would think he would’ve been able to wear it all fall and winter. So mamas order it way way bigger than you think it’ll be, at least that way you’ll get some use out of it. The legs are a bit short on him too. Oh well. Better luck next time. On and as reference i received this Aug 20, 2018. It’s a little over a month now and he only wore it a couple times when the temp dropped but again for 12-18 MONTHS i really thought he could wear it thru the end of the year at least. Original review: Absolutely LOVE! It fits somewhat large because i ordered it that way so my son can actually get some use out of it. 6 months old going on 9month clothes."

The kunai knife inside the packaging was clean, neat, and undamaged as well. This product is definitely worth the purchase because it actually resembles the real thing (except that it’s plastic). Normally when searching for props such as this for my cosplays, I’m skeptical as to whether or not the product is legit and worth spending money on... this plastic kunai knife is definitely worth it. The only thing I changed with this plastic knife is the wrap around the grip area. I changed out the white ribbon it came with to white athletic sports wrap. Swapping out the ribbon for the white athletic sports wrap just makes the grip area feel better in my hand. I also practiced throwing the plastic kunai knife outside and it held up well, no damage to the knife (only to the poor grass I was throwing the knife at haha). Will definitely purchase again to add more to my “ninja” cosplay collection."

      "text": "Absolutely adorable and comfortable for my little guy to wear to his uncle's wedding in Colorado. However it needed a bit of work to be presentable. It definitely isn't ready- to- wear. First of all the tags were sewn on the outside of the outfit as you can see in the pictures... like... why? So I had to carefully cut those off without cutting the seam. Secondly, the buttons in the pant area don't allow for full closure and so you can see his diaper. Just poorly designed. Since I purchased this right before the wedding, I only had time to use velcro to keep that area closed which was annoying. I got size 6-9 month and the fit is just right not too big and not snug. He's on the overage size for 6 months but if you have a bigger baby it might be too small. The bow tie hangs off the top button and is easy to remove. It fell off a few times and could easily be removed. I wish I had stitched it on instead. The pros is the softness and stretch of the material and that its just one piece which was super comfy for my 6 month old. Easy access for diaper changes. The material used for the shirt is a bit thick which wasn't a problem in the cool weather of Colorado but could be too warm for baby is temps over 80F. Little man looked cute and comfy for the wedding but if you want a ready- to- wear you'll be in for a surprise as this outfit needed some fixes."

Fit was a bit big around the waist but my little boy is probably a skinny little thing without much baby fat or a belly. Probably more of a 9 month fit than 6 months (got 6-9 month size)."

      "title": "Sort-of an ok replacement for my KMart Basic Editions womens short jeans",
      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2020",
      "text": "I have been wearing KMart Basic Editions womens short (not petite) jeans forEVER. I liked that they were on the less thick/heavy side and had a stretch without becoming over-stretched. I especially liked that they sat just below the belly button in the front but sat high enough up in the back that they were almost at the waist and didn't slide down my butt when I knelt or bent over. I found that they wore fairly well and washed well (I've worn them to do yard work and gotten them really dirty). I have been every size from 18 down to 6 (and up and down again and again) and still have been able to get my size in SHORT length. I especially liked that I could get them at regular price for under $20, sometimes on sale from $10-13. Unfortunately, they seem to be going the way of the dinosaur and so I've been forced to search for a replacement. I have been having a really hard time because I want a thinner material, in SHORT, sitting just at the waist (not mid-rise), straight but not tight, with some stretch, and with good-sized pockets, and a price that is reasonable. I can't wear Gloria Vanderbilt (they're just too tightly cut in every size); I find Dickies too \"industrial\"-looking and the material too heavy; in many store brands the material is too heavy or not stretchy enough and most don't come in short in a cut I like. Add to all this that I've been trying to buy online because I need jeans and the pandemic has resulted in a lot of store closures. I read a lot of reviews for many brands and finally settled on trying Lee. I am currently a size 6 (at the large end of the size range), but depending on cut and stretch could be an 8; short (not petite) length (29 inch inseam). I am 5'2\", 132 lbs (but this fluctuates upward) and carry weight a little bit more at my waist and hips. I was on the fence as to whether to give the Lee jeans 3 or 4 stars, but since I just ordered a second pair I think it's only fair to give 4 stars. With that said, they are the best replacement that I've found so far for my KMart jeans, but they are by no means comparable. Here's why: 1. The waist band is fairly thick and it bunches at the button when I sit down, sticking me in the belly button and giving me the dreaded sweaty waist. 2. The jeans material itself has some stretch (not so much in the waist) but the material is a heavier weight than the KMart jeans--perhaps more of a mid-weight material. For some this might be a plus but on a hot (80 degree), humid, sunny day, the Lee's are definitely hard to wear comfortably, whereas I had no issue with my old KMart jeans. 3. Some reviewers commented on the minniscule front pockets and they weren't kidding. If I still had my old flip phone I would have to turn it sideways to get it in; it won't fit an iPhone. The front pocket needs a reality check and a redesign. But given my limited jeans options, I put up with it. 4. Others would consider $23 or so reasonably priced, but for jeans that I am going to beat up (gardening, cleaning the house, getting bleach and stains on them, etc.) I really want to have a good chance of paying under $20 and I couldn't get there (I had to hunt around to find them for $23-ish). Now for the good points: 1. They do not ride down my butt in the back (the way mid-rise jeans with stretch do on me), but instead stay firmly at my waist. This is the first pair of jeans out of the ones bought in my replacement \"quest\" that stayed put. 2. They have a small amount of stretch but did not stretch out in the washer and dryer (hot and hot settings). 3. They come in SHORT (petite is the wrong cut for me). When the stores reopen I will give up the on-line search in favor of trying on jeans in the stores, but for now these Lees are as close as I can get to my old Basic Editions jeans--sort-of. I hope this review helps anyone else hunting for replacement jeans."

It arrived a little scratched up (but I think that’s just because of the material). Not a big deal for me, but it could be for someone else. 2. There really should be some sort of stitching around the top and handle portion for support and to give it a better-quality look. 3.

Overall, I give it a solid 7 out of 10. It’s the size and color that I want. But the quality could be a little better for the price."

I hope it softens with time because it's a bit uncomfortable to carry as unbending as the handle portion is currently. If it softens up it will be my favorite bag and should last virtually forever."

I usually wear a 14/16 in dresses. I ordered an XL and it fit PERFECTLY. I'm 5'7 and this costume is short enough to be sexy but long enough to wear in public without being uncomfortable. It is costume material, sure, but it really is made well. I have had the other costume for 4 or 5 years now, wearing it every Oktoberfest. I can see this one lasting just as long. Impressed!!"

I really like the shoulder strap, that I am able to adjust it to a shorter length for myself without long loose strap sticking out and getting in my way. The marthing clutch is perfect for my personal supplies and meds etc. I always use the detachable wrist strap for my key fob so it is easy to attach it to one of the hardware pieces on the handles so I don't loose it in the purse itself. The little outside zipper pocket is too small for my phone but perfect to keep a lip balm or lipstick handy. I would definitely purchase this again."

The lock on the front. It's like a solid tin or something. The part it hangs off is the same material and the two jostle and clang which can be pretty annoying. My mom thinks she'll be fine with it (bought this as a gift for her) but if not we'll get bolt cutters and hang a different charm on it. The second thing is the lining of the purse. It's a kind of nylon and while great for cleaning, it makes a rustling papery sound. Again, something my mom said she can live with, as this purse has all the features she wanted (hard to find!)"

      "text": "This might be one of my favorite purchases ever. I genuinely believe this can look beautiful in everyone. I am considerably overweight, middle aged and I bought a size smaller than I should- and I still looked better in this than I could believe. I went ahead and bought a size bigger in a different color so I could have one now, and since I'm losing baby and hormone weight now, I'll keep this smaller one for in a few months. The material is both soft and stretchy. And the tied halter allows you to make it fit exactly as you want. While being sexy at the same time. This is great for tall women like me who struggle to get teddies that don't qualify as a Pap smear. The front vee elongates the body, and hides/ shows just the right amount of the boobs to be attractive in both young and perkies or older and saggies. The hip flare adds a little curve but also covers a little curve. The belt is so slimming, even if you're less slim there than you'd like. I cannot recommend this enough. It's so comfy and will make you feel like a million bucks. And it's so inexpensive compared to \"higher-end\" brands, you'll feel like you got a steal."

The sewn-in labels detached and the lining on the inner sole lifted at the toes almost immediately but, with the hassle of returning them and the weather getting colder, I didn't bother. They feel a bit like well-worn Uggs or Mahabis, OK for occasional use but not if you're looking for something that will give the support I'd expected from the memory foam usp. They feel an awful lot harder than I expected. Not squishy at all but not supportive either. Warm but not comfortable. However! As indoor to outdoor mules these are great! Obviously you can't remove the soles (as you can do with the older Mahabis) but they are perfect as footwear that bridges the gap between your soft and fluffy couch tattie baffies and your big clumpy outdoor boots."

My feet guided my fingers over the keyboard and the other day my new Keepsakes mules arrived...beautifully packaged I might say. Well, as soon as I put these on my feet I realised that they were like nothing else I'd ever put on my feet before. The comfort and relief is instant. Something about the design means that the soles are kind of sprung in some way and you bounce as you walk. They are completely moulded to your feet and the feeling of support is amazing.My feet are now in heaven and I would recommend these mules to anyone who finds normal shoes, even with insoles, not supportive enough for their painful feet. I wish there was a waterproof version so that I could live in them forever!"

I ordered my usual shoe size, and they fit well."

      "text": "These are the MOST expensive slippers I've ever bought but I'm old & thought I deserved them. I'm not a conspiracy theorist but I'm wondering if my ex-husbands have got together and contacted you with a plan? Perhaps they've got a new insurance out on me? The slippers nearly killed me pootling about in my retirement home yesterday. I fell over due to the sole coming half way off and sticking me to the carpet but managed to avoid breaking a hip as I fell onto a very surprised neighbour who is still recovering (I'm a BIG woman!). I tried to glue gun them this morning which has resulted in dubious gunk on the sides but still not stuck the sole and slipper together. Then tried Super Glue which spurted out all over my hands. Hands that have arthritis AND contact dermatitis. I am left with very expensive slippers with a gaping sole and what looks like someone has jizzed on them. I've discovered that rubbing alcohol does NOT get superglue off of my already sore hands and neither does petroleum jelly. My glue gun is now stuck to a box, I have no skin on a patch of my thumb and the glue still stuck to me is now stinging. The other slipper that is in working order WAS very comfortable and didn't try to assassinate me but I'm scared to wear it as:- 1) It would make me limp. 2) The same thing may happen. 3) My ex-husbands could receive their payout."

I used to go barefoot all the time but as I have gotten older I have noticed various aches and pains in my feet and back. I have very high arches and my podiatrist told me I need better support for my feet. These are one of the better shoes to help support my arches. I have purchased a few pairs on Amazon and others on the Birkenstock website. I will now only purchase them on Amazon when Amazon is the seller as the ones I received from other sellers don't seem to last as long which makes me wonder about the authenticity."

      "text": "I have been wearing Birkenstock Gizehs for 20 years. I don't wear any other brands or style of sandals because I love them. Yes, they are expensive but they last a really long time & can be repaired when they get really beat up. I have lost count of just how many pairs I own but I think I have at least 10 pairs. I had Plantar Fasciitis many years ago and I require good arch support to keep it from reoccurring. I have never had problem since I started wearing these. They do take some getting used to if you have not worn Birkenstocks before & they do require a little \"break in\" time but it is well worth the effort. I can't speak for other styles of Birkenstocks but I can say that the Gizeh runs really big so SIZE DOWN. I wear 7-1/2 or 8M in shoes but in these I wear 37 which they describe as size 6. I'm no size 6 but I can tell you that even though I'm usually 7-1/2 or 8, every pair of Birkenstocks Gizehs I have are size 37M and they fit me like they were custom made for me. FYI, Birkenstock has recently started making an EVA version of the Gizeh which is pretty much like rubber flip flops but they are practically as comfortable as the $100 ones, still have great arch support, can get as wet as you want and they cost a fraction of the price. You should be able to find them for around $40. Again, really expensive for flip flops but although I don't know how long they last, I think they are worth the price."

This year, I wanted to try a different style and I chose this Gizeh sandal. They actually make my old feet look cute! The break in period was a bit painful due to the really stiff toe post that has no give. But I didn’t want to give up on them. So a week later, my feet have fully accepted the toe post and my floppy arches are in love with the arch supports built into Birkenstock footbeds! If you’re on the fence, I urge you to try the Gizeh!!!"

      "text": "First of all, I have wanted a pair of these for years and could never justify the price tag from the original source. I was sceptical when I found these on amazon as they are very well reduced from the normal price and wondered if they were fake. I scoured the reviews and couldn't really find any evidence to suggest they are, so hey bonus! The second worry I had was the size. I am a 6.5 but normally have to size up to a 7 as hardly anywhere does half sizes, again after reading all the reviews I took the advice and ordered a 5.5, cursing myself as I did it, expecting them to arrive and have to be sent back straight away. Fast forward to today when they arrive, they are in proper birkenstock packaging, they look and feel very sturdy, the name on the side is nice and clear everything suggests that they are the real McCoy. Next test is trying them on.. and they fit!! Now they say they are a 39 so I guess you could say that they are a 6 rather than a 5.5 but either way, I certainly wouldn't be able to cram feet in to a 6. They feel secure and comfortable enough and as I've read they will get more comfortable over time. So it's a long winded 5 star review, am absolutely made up with my purchase.. well done Amazon"

One disappointment was the mask- it came a part (elastic from mask) within an hour of pulling it out of the bag. I was able to sew it back together, but it was an added hassle. Other than that the costume has held up very well in the last week. My girl wears it to play outside and wore it for her Halloween party at PreK. Good buy for a great price"

      "text": "This held up well on Halloween. My daughter is 5 years old and she normally wears a size 5/6. This costume was a bit big on her, but once we put on the layering needed for cold Missouri trick or treating it worked out pretty well. I still pulled it back a little with a safety pin just to make sure the neck line stayed where it needed to. The skirt did have glitter and that was the only downfall. It did not last very long. I'd say by the end of trick or treating most of the glitter was gone. Especially on her right side where she was carrying her bucket. This wasn't a huge issue for us and honestly it doesn't really break the outfit if it's not on there. She did have trouble keeping the mask in the right spot so she ended up putting that aside before the end of the night, but that was okay too. Now they use the costume for dress up at home and still it's held up. No complaints here!"

She was 34 inch (86 cms) that day. She's a slim girl. An ADVICE that i can give you is this: IF YOU NEED THIS COSTUME for a birthday party, halloween or any other special celebration try not wash it because the Spider on the chest vanish in the second (maybe first) cleaning, But i only want it for 2 days only I boght this 1 motnh before and i kept it safe and without getting it dirty.

I could have gotten her true size, but I am happy with this. She cannot wait to wear it on Halloween. I also purchased bright red spiderman gloves and the red spider girl tights. She plans on wearing a black turtleneck under the costume. We also purchased a toy like product that is worn on the wrist and shoot a spider web thread/lightweight rope, preferred this to the one that you had to use a canned product of some sort that sprayed web like webs, thought refills would be costly, thus bought the one with thread/rope, shoot, load it back up, shoot again, easy."

I ordered the mid sized range (2.2) which are plenty big enough for me) & now im going to purchase the smaller (1.6) as i have real ones...but lost one. OUCH! Now that i see they look so great... i can wear one of these along with the real. Or....since i have three holes in one ear...i can mix & match & wear 3 triangle or wear my real round brilliant & add 1 triangle or whatever i want. Love to mix & match. Plus you cannot beat the price + quality!! I had some high end trillion cut \"absolutes\" from Suzanne Sommers from back in the day....while they were nice they were also pricey. These are just as nice but for much less the price. As always...best part is if you lose one....its no big deal!! I still feel the sting from losing that one real trillion! Grab a pair or two & look fabulous...no one will be the wiser! xoPam, still Kelli's mom"

  "description": "From the brand Previous page ABOUT US HONEYCAT is a California-based, female-founded and women-led jewelry brand started by two best friends, Julie & Jo. As a small business, we're unlike most of the faceless businesses you see on Amazon... we curate every microscopic design from jewelry specs to packaging design. Plus, we personally package your orders and answer your customer inquiries! We design high-quality, delicate jewelry founded on the belief that every woman should feel pretty on a day to day basis without having to trend-chase or spend a fortune. We strive to be the marriage between fashion and fine jewelry and to be an affordable, high quality alternative to fine jewelry. We use the highest quality materials possible within the fashion jewelry range. Next page Product Description A pair of sleek starburst studs in a petite silhouette. Gorgeous whether worn solo or alongside your favorite earrings. Our materials make for an amazing, high quality, seamless, jewelry piece with longevity. Our earrings are plated with 18k gold, 18k rose gold, or rhodium and finished with a protective coating. A little secret we’ll keep between us: it looks way more than it costs. OUR MANTRA We offer a meaningful selection of delicate jewelry founded on the belief that every woman should feel pretty on a day to day basis without having to trend-chase. Our jewelry is designed to be classic, simple, meaningful and able to be worn everyday. Like a layer of mascara or perfume, we hope putting on a piece of our jewelry becomes a staple part of your morning routine. MATERIALS Our jewelry is plated in 18k gold, 18k rose gold, rhodium, or sterling silver. We finish each piece with a protective coating that allows it to hold up better against daily evils like sweat, which typically makes jewelry susceptible to tarnishing. Our materials composition make for an amazing, wearable, high quality, seamless jewelry piece with longevity. We strive to be the marriage between fashion and fine jewelry. We use the highest quality materials possible within the fashion jewelry range. CARE Jewelry should be kept away from cleaning agents, beauty products, and water, and stored in a cool, dry place to discourage tarnishing (pro-tip: this is how you should care for all your jewelry). Clean your jewelry with a soft cotton or microfiber cloth when necessary. OUR STORY We’ve been BFFs ever since meeting in our awkward preteen years and finding out we share the same sense of fearlessness and ambition for freedom. We believe in positive thinking, getting sh*t done, and the good (and bad) that karma brings. Our jewelry pieces are indicative of this spirit – we hope they inspire you by way of being a constant reminder of your inner strength + dreams. Read more ",

Original backings should be pinched as tight as you can before wearing, or in my case I’m using rubber backings for them which I feel are more secure. They have a little dimension to them witch makes them more visually interesting and sophisticated. Love these earrings, would absolutely recommend!"

A little celestial influence is always a plus and these little starbursts did not disappoint. Sturdy feeling when you put them on, but very light and sweet as an accent. My only confusion was the directions that stated to keep them away from water, cleaners, etc.. I did rub some alcohol on the stud part before putting them in, just to be safe without any discernible change to the metal."

Stretchy material keeps them comfortable yet also keeps their shape. Color stays & although you can technically tell they're not brand new, they still look great with no tears, seams coming out or \"runs\" (like similar spandex products can suffer when grazing rough materials!) Always look for new patterns or colors & never disappoint with relatively consistent pricing when you compare elsewhere! For reference, I'm approx. size 6-8 in various pants/shorts & the Medium in the Endless Summer 2\" Board Shorts has remained consistent for all these years as well! (I'm conservative in nature, so don't be alarmed by the \"2 inch\" detail; they cover appropriately for what they're meant to do & extra elastic waistband - similar to pregnancy styles - makes even us non-maternity qualified gals appreciate the stretch!)"

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2020",
      "text": "I just bought a new pair, have had a previous pair (same exact model) for 3 years and have ridden at least 2000 miles in them. I love these shorts, and they are 1 of 2 (now 2 of 2) primary riding shorts, and have held up almost perfectly. No durability issues. Like some other reviewers, me in tight riding shorts is no longer in anyone's best interest, so I appreciate the \"modesty\" of these shorts. Some folks call these mountain biking shorts, but I use them for road biking and they work fine. Pad is on the big side, as noted by other reviewers, but doesn't bother me at all. Problems that prevented a 5-star rating: 1) Like others, I've had issues with the zipper on the old pair. I find that when the zipper pops open, I can fix it by pulling it all the way down and then back up, but I've had a couple rides with extra ventilation because I didn't catch the zipper malfunction. So it's not a deal breaker for me, but definitely not something that should happen on shorts at this price point. 2) My older pair are tan. I always use sunscreen when I ride, and the leg fabric quickly became permanently stained a grayish color for the bottom 2\" or so -- I assume from the sunscreen and/or my sweat. Really hoping my new (gray camo) pair doesn't stain. A couple reviewers complained about the front pockets on these. Yeah, they're basically useless when riding because of shallowness, location and lack of zipper/velcro to seal them. BUT you get a zippered pocket on side of each thigh, another one on back of right thigh, and a zippered wallet pocket. Between these and the fact that all my riding shirts/jackets have multiple pockets, I don't miss the front pockets at all. Overall, I LOVE these shorts. UPDATE: My recently (2020) purchased version of these shorts have no zipper issues, and the fabric has not been stained by my sunscreen. I consider these 2 issues resolved."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2015",
      "text": "For me with about a 34 waist give or take, the fit was a little too snug. The open pockets were well positioned and they wear well as shorts, but depending upon the liner I use when riding they can be tight and constricting. I find that the Revelry (also in L) because they are larger even though L, have no contraction whatsoever when I ride in them. I am going to try XL in these, but I fear it will be too large... What was annoying about these (a combination of the design and the fabric) was that the back has a huge amount of bunched up fabric where the elastic is - which feels like plastic and is scratchy and annoying. The Revelry does not have this, nor does the Ether LT for me (which is in size L not the same size as this regular Ether in size L). The big problem with the Zoic shorts are that the sizes for mens L are NOT anywhere near the same from one style to another. I purchased in size mens L: Black Market Ether Ether LT Revelry See photo. NONE of them are the same size waist even though ALL of them are mens size L. All of them have elastic bands in them of one size or another, but it does not work out to fix the problem as the largest L (Revelry) get bunched up when pulled tight enough for me, while at the other end of the spectrum the Black Markets are so tight that they are not possible to tolerate. Every short in mens L: 36 inch waist - Revelry 34 inch waist - Ether LT 32.5 inch waist Ether 30 inch waist Black Market The waist size for size L Revelry is 36 inches, Black Market size L is 30 inches! This is absolutely absurd! Please see the attached photo. The left edges are lines up, they are all flat with no stretching. Specifically for Black Market what makes it even worse is that the waist is 30 inches but it comes with an integrated belt that is nearly 40 inches long! A 30 inch waist and a 40 inch integrated belt! The other shorts have nice design and quality, without this 'feature' of the Black Market. I also found that for Black Market shorts the non-zipper pockets puff open and are not at a good angle. The non-zipper pockets on the Ether and Ether LT are perfect position. In the zipper only Revelry, all the pockets were fine. The zippers appeared good. I can't say what the actual waist measurements are for other sizes than L. Who knows!"

Also Id like two back pockets instead of just the one right hand back pocket. Also the zipper enclosure of the one back pocket could be slightly wider as I can barely get my hand in there to extract my money and any other things I put there. I also would like to see them add belt loops to the shorts for days when I want to carry extra weight in my pockets, as a pound or two of weight tends to cause the shorts to keep sliding down. If you tighten the waist too much with them built in belt you risk popping the waistband button open as its a snap button rather than a button or fastener that locks better or a combination, although the present velcro reinforcement near the snap button certainly helps."

Unfortunately, that's not the same universe we live in. I wear a 42-44 waste pant and have athletic legs. I bought the 3XL since everyone else said these run small. And what to you know, they are tight. It's not just these, I have the same problem with shorts in general. Beyond that, they're still comfortable and breathe nicely. I haven't tried the padded liner yet, but even without the liner they worked good on my bike in just regular undies. So, 4 stars because they still do the job they were designed to do, but I'm docking a star until whatever universe shorts (in general) are made in aligns with ours finally."

I ordered a 9 for myself and a 10 for my sister (usual sizes) after believing the top-rated comments (\"they feel tight at first but just wait...) Well, we both could barely get or normal size on our feet. I tried the 10 on (I have never had to buy a 10 shoe in my life) and it still feels barely long enough and way too tight for a comfy lounging/going out for the mail slipper. I don't want to take the risk of trying to break them in and then not being able to send them back if they still feel tight after a week. The rubber soles are much narrower than my previous moccasin-style slippers (LL Bean and UGG) and they makes my feet feel \"perched\" on the soles. There is no arch support, which I think the narrowness of the sole makes worse - no room for your foot to spread out. I love the idea of my ankles wrapped in that lovely wool, but I didn't expect the upper to feel so hard-molded. Great look but not the feel I was expecting. Both slippers are going back and will probably re-order a different slipper altogether."

I ended up returning them and I started contemplating on whether or not to get another pair in my size. Now that I have the size 10, they fit somewhat better. There is still some slipping, but I’ll try to get used to that. The toe area is snug but bearable. Overall, the shoes are cute and very warm. I think they should be called “Snugg” slippers!😆"

After reading reviews I decided on the size 8 nightfall and it’s extremely tight in the toe and slightly hard to get on. Maybe it will loosen up with wear (as most uggs do the wool kind of forms to your foot) I also don’t think these are real uggs. The sizing is off and you don’t get the authenticity card that I’ve gotten every time I’ve bought uggs in the past. Really good dupe though. In the end, it’s a decent shoe. Size up. Size up. Size up."

Size wise I can be a 7.5 or 7, they run narrow in the toe, so I would be normally a 7wide for a narrow running shoes. Sizing said to get 7 which is what I purchased, they are very very snug at 1st for length and width. I've only had them for 6days. They've stretched a bit but now the sole is coming apart like the glue didnt stick (picture I only took a bit of it out because some of it is still glued). I've only been wearing them in the house and wearing them when I can not alot since I work lol but I was hoping they would stretch and fit if I bared through it, which again they have (not a lot, but a bit, still snug). I would say not worth the money, unless you have it to spare. Also, no arch support, which is okay I wouldn't wear them out the house or for a long period of time. I have been wearing them with no sock (which I'm not a huge fan of) or a thin pair socks because of the rubbing on my big toe. All in all will not purchase again."

I could not wait to love these and never take them off. Not in Hollywood, but Up in the North Country. But..as WONDERFULLY SILKY-SMOOTH that the wool felt against my foot, the best woll there is was missing at the top/tip of one's toes? -sadly these mocs have a gap in the plushest fur where the top stitched seam meets the side of the mocassin? A BARE SPOT AT THE TIP OF MY TOES ! THIS IS WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD. Where the feet freeze first and its the last to get warm.MOST OF US LIVING IN actual COLD climates.. do need serious lining and Uggs used to be reliably thick up front. And coming fresh off a cold UPS TRUCK ON A WINDY DAY..MADE THE FUR SO WELCOME. AND a long, BLAZINGLY COLD ZONE, felt immediately- is purely disappointing. BAD BATCH? Quality control? Not a big deal these days? Again, some maybe wont mind and others will find it insulting at full price, nearly the top UGGs SLIPPER PRICE. We have a probem. Sizing:was small on my medium width size 7 foot. The 8 was way to tight on the length. It hurt. So they needed 2 sizes up. My foot loked awful long already! In a 9 I dont think they get daintier on a five foot tall woman.The toes curled up too. Elfie. Uggs has missed the reason many of us eventualy replace very well worn Uggs with an upgrade. We loved our od pair, why did we haveto make do with hight costs, and less quality?"

But my biggest issue with these is that they are NOT SHEEPSKIN. I love love love UGGs and own at least twelve pairs of boots and slippers and I love the full shearling/sheepskin lining. This slipper is made of some new jazz they're using now called \"UGG purewool\" - which is just wool FLUFF that's woven into a fabric backing. It says so on the little information card inside the box. (But not on all the descriptions on the amazon listing, and not very noticeabley either so I didn't realize it until I got the delivery.) I expect shearling when I buy UGGs - that's what they are known for, especially in slippers! This \"purewool\" lining feels MUCH less soft and luxurious than the shearling and I'm not sure it would breath/wick in the same way either (although any kind of wool lining will have wicking and warming qualities.) This must be UGG's way of boosting their profit margin ---> cutting corners, using a cheap wool lining instead of pricey shearling - but still charging an arm and a leg. Not cool."

      "text": "After lots of hat research, I got this hat just in time for our vacation. It was a bit tight on me at first (I have an average size head). If you have a large head this hat isn't for you. I hand washed it in cool water and put it on my head several times while it was drying to stretch it out a bit. Since it's 100% cotton it did stretch to fit my head perfectly. I'm not used to wearing hats, but since we were spending a day at an amusement park while on vacation, I thought this would be perfect. It's exactly as described and you don't have to adjust it to see things since it has a shorter bill. I thought a big floppy hat would just annoy me since I'm not a hat person normally. So this was great for me. It does come with a removable strap, but I didn't use it since the hat was snug to begin with. I could see the strap being handy if it's really windy outside though. This hat was great for a day at the park and not getting sunburned on my head, ears, forehead, neck! Yay for that!"

What I liked: Love the length of the shirts as I’m taller and don’t want a tunic length top or fit for a classic tee. Loved the slick feel of the fabric as it’s a cotton blend. Loved the offerings of colors and/or designs. Did not like: I had seen this in other photos posted in reviews and hedged my bets, but had the same issue - unsure if its the fit or if it’s the cut - but it tends to give pull lines between the breast and armpit like it’s almost a bit small, but it fits over the chest fine, is it the armscye or sleeve? Combination of all? I would probably move up to a plus for future purchase if it got rid of this issue and also if it gave me just a bit more room in the torso for width and not as form fitting over my mama rolls. My other issue; and I only had this while traveling in Florida in October, it was a bit warmer/not allowing as much breathability in hot and humid weather which I’d chalk off to the blend of fabric and being in the hot sun. In non humid weather the shirts have been comfortable and feel nice on the skin. Will try these again. Note: Amazon please change the description heading! These aren’t shorts!"

I bought XL being a size 18. I think the LARGE would probably of been big enough. They run a bit on the big side. The only thing I really dislike is the fact that they FLARE OUT at the bottom! Not a look I like. Not sure whether it would of made a difference if I had bought the next size down though. Material is soft and stretchy, but I’m wondering how the neck will be after washing. The reviews for that, are not good! Guess I’ll just have to wait and see."

I've not bought an Amazon \"own brand\" piece of clothing before and am very pleased to say that these t-shirts are excellent quality. I mean what can you really say about a t-shirt but if it's rubbish it's rubbish but these aren't. Good fair price - the fit is as expected, good colour (grey) and nice and soft. Very pleased"

I’m still nursing so I’m very top heavy at the moment! The Large fits perfectly, makes me feel great wearing a two piece again, and I wore it to the beach and twisted the flowy part around the center strap as it does retain water in the flowy part! It can be a tad uncomfortable when wet, but that is a tweak you can make while waiting for it to dry!"

I love the fabric v in front covers my belly, the high waist contains my fluffiness, and that I look decent ! Granted as long as the sun is out I wear a rash guard but for night swims I can feel pretty !

I have a larger bust than fit in any of the suits I tried buying this year (34DD) and though I wear a size 6-8 bottoms I bought the Large/10-12 in this suit. The top fits great. I popped the pads out as I hate removable pads and the swingy, printed top offers enough coverage. The bottoms I could go a size down but they work fine. They are a cheekier cut- I didn’t see that mentioned when I bought. It’s still flattering and cute but definitely not a full coverage back if you have a booty. I’m very short so there’s only a little peek of skin between the bottoms and the top around the sides and back. I love that the straps can cross. The hardware can poke a bit at the back where they connect but nothing terrible. The straps adjust well even for short torsos like me. I’d buy again in other prints."

PJ's are supposed to be loose fitting and the waist band should fit past the belly button. This being said, these PJ's are on the low side of a passing grade. Because of the price, and comfort is satisfactory, and I will wear them, these get an over all passing grade."

II will buy this in other colors as well, as the fit is good for me. I'm 5'1\" so I need a cropped sweater, but they are easier to find with 3/4 sleeves. Finding one with the longer sleeves I prefer makes them easier to wear year round. I also have a deformed wrist bone from an injury so I like to cover it up. Not the finest sweater I've ever owned, but for a relatively cheap price you aren't going to get a perfectly-tailored cashmere. I think this is likely one manufacturer sold under several brands.

It barely fits and she will probably push the sleeves up to 3/4. I would size up 1, probably 2 sizes if purchasing again."

      "text": "I sized up in this because I was wanting a looser fit for over top of tight dresses. I got exactly what I was figuring I would but in the future I may just go with my usual size (M) since this item had a lot of good stretch to it. Normally I highly recommend the Grace Karen brand because they have some of the best quality fabric for clothing I’ve ordered online..but this cardigan was a definite exception. The fabric is okay at best, it’s a lighter sweater but would work well for most weather. But it has a very flimsy & thin feeling to it around the edges, such as the sleeve ends that makes me concerned that this sweater will be very quick to pill & fray in the next few washes. I will update if it does fray quickly..but I’ve got my fingers crossed for it. My biggest disappointment was how cheaply done the buttons are for the price of this item. I don’t mind having to resew a bottom occasionally on a sweater like this..but they look like they were barely hanging on to begin with when it arrived new. Also the button holes themselves, rather then have any protective sewing along it’s edges in the hole so that they will be resistant to wear, it’s like they were made with a machine cut & just left at that. This will cause the button holes to fray considerably in short time from regular use & I’m quite disappointed with that..all of the edges of this sweater are made in this fashion & I had the sleeves/opening/button holes already begin to look worn out after the first wash in gentle (hung to dry). Just not very impressed with that detail since this is one of the pricier cardigans I’ve bought & had a higher standard from how well other Grace Karen clothes were normally made. I wouldn’t suggest this cardigan for more than costume wear or one of use. It’s just not built to last & I’m sure a cheaper priced alternative could be found for something of this lower quality.

I realize by the pictures it does show it is cropped, but I thought I could get away with it :) If you have a long torso definitely skip this one. The one star removed is for the fabric feel. Quite itchy and scratchy. Otherwise a very nice looking sweater and I am sending jealous vibes to all you \"normies\" in the torso department :) Hope this review helps! 205 lbs/5'6/40 D chest for size comparison, I ordered 3x."

I had to order this dress three times… and I almost gave up with this dress lol 1st order) I saw embroidery on the chest area was coming off but I thought I could fix it otherwise I thought it was perfect and I was going to hand wash it few days before the photoshoot and I noticed that the end of the dress on the back was ripped and patched at the factory. It had a hole too. It’s end of the skirt so you can’t really tell unless you get close but it’s not $10 dress, I thought it’s better to exchange. 2nd order) why?! Same size but 1-2inch smaller on the under chest area and dress was shorter than the 1st one that I order… it’s definitely tighter than the 1st one… not sure if factory mistakenly put Medium label on Large size on the 1st one??? Shoulder and everything else was same fit so I don’t think that’s the case… it’s just a quality of this dress/company… also the embroidery on the top area was also coming off on this but I could fix it so didn’t care. Side of the dress was a bit wrinkled (didn’t lined evenly so it get wrinkled up a bit) It didn’t look smooth so I was like f this. I’ll order another one to see which dress is perfect!!! 3rd order) omg… it’s tighter than the second one by a bit lol 😂 length of the dress is same as the second one. I saw two holes on the lace in the front which were tiny but bothered me…. Also the sleeve length on each side is different… 😩 one sleeve was longer than the other… it didn’t look good so I decided to return this one. I was gonna keep the first one since it feels comfy even though it’s messed up on the back but my husband said it’s too long (dragging on the floor) and he said I look better on the second one so I keep the second order and returned two of them. Maybe I’m being picky but quality of the dress is not that great. I won’t complain if it was $19 dress… It’s just for photoshoot so I keep one and stick with it."

I’m almost a size 12 so I selected the XL size as that matched my measurements most closely with at least an inch to spare on the information provided. I wanted it to be a touch oversize and it is, it’s just perfect! It does up with three hook and eye fastenings with nothing lower than the waist so there’s no problem if I’m sitting down. It fits neatly at the neck but there is no collar, the pile of the faux fur is so thick, I don’t think it would be possible to incorporate one without it sitting oddly. Instead I have a couple of lovely scarves which would look great. Not sure if I would ever need to though, this jacket is very warm! Pink satin lined, seriously comfy, decent sleeve length and not too small across the shoulders, I’m looking forward to wearing it!"

The shoes were on a crazy discount and they're so cute, so I wanted to gamble and just hope it didn't happen to me. Welp, I lost that bet. But you know what, I hardly even care! They're still so cute and the dye isn't hard to wash off. I can imagine the dye being difficult to remove if you have a lot of calluses on the bottoms of your feet, but I frequently exfoliate so the dye removes with ease."

      "text": "Reviewed after a year of wearing: A true reproduction of a lightweight, breathable classic. These are fantastic especially for the price. They are a Japanese shoe and may run the tiniest bit snug, but not so much that you should change your size just enough that it's choice for narrow feet. These shoes add a pinch of height, as the tread comes out a bit. Speaking of which the tread is interesting... Doesn't do much to add grip but it's nice that rocks won't get stuck in them. The downsides of this shoe are what makes it nice. The upper is such a soft synthetic that your feet aren't really being kept in place at all. The sole being a bit narrow, especially coming in on the inside of your foot means that if you stand funny, the insides of your feet can just almost hang over the shoe. The strangest thing about these shoes however is that the extra laces came already laced meaning they had a white and a black set of laces already laced up... Double laced how odd is that? These make great beaters and the thick tread means they'll last me at least another year. I'm pleased."

      "text": "I have been previously wearing the women's version of this shoe, (as I am a woman) but, since the all black with the hint of red trim around the ankle was not available in women's, I opted to just convert the size into the men's sneaker. Amazon has a cool little do-dad where you tell them the make and model of the well fitting shoe you currently own, and they tell you what size you should order in the new shoe, with an image to predict how the shoe will fit all over in comparison to the old shoe. I would have guessed to buy 2 sizes down, but I went ahead with the recommendation of a size and a half down, and it was correct. In general, it's a very good fit, the only difference being that the toe box is slightly narrower in the men's shoe than it is in the women's shoe. I took the insoles out and replaced them with my orthotic insoles by Arch Rival. (also purchased on Amazon) They fit perfectly, and work well in these sneakers. I have been sticking with Saucony for the last 4 pairs of shoes I have purchased because, since wearing them, the severe plantar fasciaitis I had been suffering with for about 3 years, has diminished to nearly nothing. I was on the brink of surgery for gastronemic recession, and now I only need to ice now and then, and/or take an NSAID occasionally to manage it. No surgery so far!"

The colors and color combos are a bit out of my spectrum. The ones I do like of course aren’t available in my size. What’s that tell you Saucony?! My second complaint would be that the tongue apparently has become too expensive to be padded. Now they are nothing more than thin Strips of fabric. What’s up with that? With this new change I can no longer slip my shoes on without having to bend over and hold onto the tongue so it doesn’t go into to shoe with my foot. Tisk, Tisk. Other than that I did find this pair that match my beloved Buckeye colors. And they do fit as they should and wear comfortably for hours and hours. Just wish the tongue had more than seven cents worth of fabric."

I don't feel any cold or wind through them at all, like I do in my old pair of saucony jazz. I waited too long to decide on which sneakers to order from the brand's website, they were sold out in my size. Was thrilled to find Amazon had them in stock.

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 14, 2022",
      "text": "This is a very cozy sherpa lined cable knit sweater. The lining is super thick & plush and extents thru the arms too. It is very cozy warm like a sweatshirt but looks like a nice cable knit sweater. I love the toggle loop closures and they are just tight enough to close the jacket completely. It comes with little plastic snaps to close it securely but they are very cheap, hard to snap together and you have to be very careful when opening them as they will pull at the knit of the sweater. I am handy with a sewing machine so I took them off and sewed on a zipper which worked great for me. Again, the toggles are plenty to keep the jacket closed I just wanted it to seal up snug as I'll be wearing it out in snowy & windy conditions. The hood it deep and wide - really cozy but not restricting which I appreciate. The yarn is a cotton blend that is soft and the weave is tight -no loose strands or pilling. The sleeves are a good length for me - able to cover my hand and most of my fingers. The pockets are an OK size - my iPhone 13 mini fits in horizontal and feels fairly secure, a bigger phone would not fit well. I will be washing it in the washer but laying flat to dry. Overall I am very happy with it and excited to have a nice looking sweater that is super warm & cozy this winter."

If I could remake, I would put zipper behind loops not the plastic snaps spread so far apart. I have put in washer, hung to dry. If I could live in it I would. It is SO TOASTY! If the prices didn't jump up with each falling degree it is outside I would order more. I purchased in summer when it was $15 cheaper. Wish I had purchased more then!! It is true to size- slightly large, but better to snuggle in. The \"sherpa\" is only in the body, not the arms, BUT arms are lines with thick warm cotton lining. Def not to wear when the winds are from Canada, as it IS a sweater, and breeze goes through, but put it under a wind breaker or winter jacket, and you will be snug as a bug! Hope this helps!!"

I thought they'd wear in and get comfy, but they just didn't. How do they look after 1000 miles? Pretty good actually. The mesh part of the upper is coming away, but the sole of the shoe still has flex. For 1k miles, I've had more expensive shoes that lasted less. Which leads me to value for money - if it wasn't for the blisters, I'd say amazing. But the fit isn't right, and they haven't worn in, so it's not great from me. Overall, I've spent more for worse running trainers, but ultimately these don't make the top 15 trainers I've had in this price range."

      "text": "DO NOT BUY these for road running!! Whilst they were very comfortable, the heels on both soles were completely worn out after 205km. (Previous running shoes I have bought at same price lasted 500km+). See photos showing top of shoes still in great condition, but heels completely worn. So for £50 I have had just over 2 months usage - Not good! I complained directly to Under Armour and they weren't interested.... they said complain to retailer (even though UA have obviously designed an inferior product). I have now asked the retailer for a refund. I will update this review with their response.....the retailer was great. Had to send shoes back for inspection, but then fully refunded. So, use this shop with confidence, but don't buy these particular shoes for running!"

      "text": "This was so perfect! It ran just a little big but that’s okay. We were able to wear an undershirt with it because I waited until the last minute to get my husband a gift, then realized I just made him a homemade human! So this came ON his birthday. There was no time to wash and dry with all my hypoallergenic soaps before putting it on baby. So I was a little happy it was big because it went straight from the package to the baby and handed to daddy! I’m going to stamp baby’s feet on the back and keep it as my husbands keepsake as his first birthday as a dad."
